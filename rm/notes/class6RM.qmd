### Week 6 Discussion Questions.

**YOUR POST :** Use the readings to answer the following questions. Please submit answers to the graded Canvas discussion post to help me keep track of your work, but when prompted please also copy / paste your work to our [Vision Board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14u3w5edvo6KSFRw2U9t1knDANFSGBWOvDjS7-ZGujos/edit?usp=sharing) so we can more easily see (and expand upon) this work together in class.

1.  **IN CLASS.** We counted the number of interruptions in a video before and after *operationalizing* an interruption. Look over the data from the class activity (see the lecture recording if you missed!) Explain how our operationalization task influenced the responses in terms of the *mean* and *standard deviation*, and how this relates to the concepts of reliability and validity.

2.  **Submit your results to the two personality surveys to this Google Form.** Which personality survey do you think described you best (and why)?

3.  **ON THE VISION BOARD.** Look over the list of personality surveys from the IPIP Website. Find a survey that measures a variable that you are interested in (for the final project, real-life, or for the purposes of completing this assignment.) Do you think this is a (face) valid way to measure the variable? Why / why not?

4.  **We Love Bread (REPLY TO ANOTHER STUDENT'S POST ON THE VISION BOARD FOR QUESTION 3).** Give an example of how this personality survey might be high or low in either (a) self-insight OR (b) self-diminishment/enhancement. Reply on the vision board, but also paste your response here to help me keep track of the grading.
