### Class Goals (for Students and Professor)

1.  Review and discuss the research article on objectivity interrogations.
2.  Review and apply terms of reliability and validity.
3.  Introduce readings on observations.

### Due Next Week before Class

1.  **Read the articles below.** Optional readings are not required; but lemme know if you read and have thoughts!
2.  **Complete Discussion 4**. Questions below, submit on Canvas and sometimes the Vision Board.
3.  **Complete Reading Quiz 4**. on Canvas.

### Readings for Next Week (and Quiz 4)

1.  [**Read through the chapter on Observational Research**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/observational-research/)**.** Focus on the different types of observational studies and the hawthorne effect.

2.  [**Read through the chapter on the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF)**](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4ggh81t64qnvz5kjrqukn/4_SPAFF_CodingScheme_ShortExcerpt.pdf?rlkey=e9er6moatfgk96du9zz3khazs&e=1&dl=0)**.** Focus on the "three rules" of people watching, and the different guidelines for behavioral coding (e.g., function, indicator, cues, counter-indicators). You can skim the stuff on "Action Units" in the face, though note this is an example of how psychologists have tried to quantify (and operationalize) emotion.

3.  [**Sign up for a FREE account with posit.cloud**](https://posit.cloud/plans/free)**.** We will use this program to analyze some data in class next week. NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF R OR STATISTICS IS ASSUMED. We will learn and practice together :) Totally fine to have questions / be confused - you won't be expected to work with this program on your own, and I think you'll find it fun.

    -   **WATCH THIS VIDEO : [Setting up your account and doing some basic math](https://www.loom.com/share/3d342fc70e724ab4bab8cd7765d3d94d)**. I also recorded a bonus video at the end of this on how to create a variable of numbers in R. Cool if you want to create your own variable, but not necessary.

    -   [**Taking a screenshot**](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org)**.** For showing what you did in R. Yay!

### Week 4 Discussion Questions.

**YOUR POST :** Use the readings to answer the following questions. Please submit answers to the graded Canvas discussion post to help me keep track of your work, but when prompted please also copy / paste your work to our [Vision Board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14u3w5edvo6KSFRw2U9t1knDANFSGBWOvDjS7-ZGujos/edit?usp=sharing) so we can more easily see (and expand upon) this work together in class.

1.  **From the SPAFF Reading.** Which of the "three rules" of people watching do you think is the most important for increasing validity of our measures? Why? Try using these three rules with someone in your real-life. Who did you choose and how did this go?

2.  **ON THE VISION BOARD : Look over the SPAFF DRAFT** that professor got started for the variable of "Interruption." Contribute at least ONE idea to the list (next to your name) from one of the following categories in the reading.

    -   What is the FUNCTION of the variable you observe?

    -   What are the INDICATORS of the variable?

    -   What are the PHYSICAL CUES of the variable?

    -   What are some COUNTER-INDICATORS for this variable that the person might define to avoid error in your observations?

3.  **Working with Computers.** We are going to use the posit.cloud program to analyze some data in this class and do real statistics. I understand that these words might trigger many negative emotions for students (but also may trigger positive emotions...life is complex!) Watch the videos on how to get setup with posit.cloud and submit a screenshot of using posit.cloud to answer a math equation that gave you trouble as a kid. Or, if you want to go into Professor Rambles Bonus Video territory, make a picture of a variable you created. Honestly, just create an account and come to class and you'll be okay.

4.  **REPLY TO ANOTHER STUDENT.** Look over their draft of the SPAFF rating scale. Help them revise at least one part of their behavioral coding guidelines to improve the validity of the observation.
