### Due Next Week before Class

1.  **Read the articles below.** Optional readings are not required; but lemme know if you read and have thoughts!
2.  **Complete Discussion 4**. Questions below, submit on Canvas and sometimes the Vision Board.
3.  **Complete Reading Quiz 4**. on Canvas.

### Readings for Next Week (and Quiz 4)

1.  [**Read through the chapter on Observational Research**](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/chapter/observational-research/)**.** Focus on the different types of observational studies and the hawthorne effect.

2.  [**Read through the chapter on the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF)**](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4ggh81t64qnvz5kjrqukn/4_SPAFF_CodingScheme_ShortExcerpt.pdf?rlkey=e9er6moatfgk96du9zz3khazs&e=1&dl=0)**.** Focus on the "three rules" of people watching, and the different guidelines for behavioral coding (e.g., function, indicator, cues, counter-indicators). You can skim the stuff on "Action Units" in the face, though note this is an example of how psychologists have tried to quantify (and operationalize) emotion.

### Week 4 Discussion Questions.

**YOUR POST :** Use the readings to answer the following questions. Please submit answers to the graded Canvas discussion post to help me keep track of your work, but when prompted please also copy / paste your work to our [Vision Board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14u3w5edvo6KSFRw2U9t1knDANFSGBWOvDjS7-ZGujos/edit?usp=sharing) so we can more easily see (and expand upon) this work together in class.

1.  **From the SPAFF Reading.** Which of the "three rules" of people watching do you think is the most important for increasing validity of our measures? Why? Try using these three rules with someone in your real-life. Who did you choose and how did this go?

2.
