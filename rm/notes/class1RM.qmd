### Week 1 Readings

1.  [**The Scientific Method in Five Easy Steps**](https://catterson.github.io/ystats/chapters/1R_WhyStats.html#part-3-how-science-the-scientific-method-in-five-easy-steps)**.** It is the same thing you did in science fair, but with more math. A quick overview, with some deeper thoughts about how to develop a research question that you care about.
2.  [**The Goldacre (2010) Chapter from “Why Clever People Believe Stupid Things”**](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mev9u3oyacrf21dvu48ac/Goldacre_2010_Chapter10.pdf?rlkey=vrcqb617zde7mye8un2xm184k&dl=0)**.** Read the section on "Patterns in Randomness" and at least one other cognitive bias. Some of these biases can be confusing - okay to use other sources or AI tools to help you understand, but let us know if you do!
3.  [**The Replication Crisis in Psychology**](https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-replication-crisis-in-psychology)**.** Focus on the definition of a replication, the reasons for non-replications, and some of the potential solutions to the problem.
4.  **OPTIONAL READINGS :** for those who would like to learn more. Let me know if you find other cool readings on these topics to add.
    -   [**More on the replication crisis in psychology**](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replication-crisis-peer-review-statistics). The article is now behind a paywall...but [here's a PDF of the article from the Internet Archive](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/21h3kcq6kc5jszo00fm6w/1_Vox_ReplicationCrisis_2020.pdf?rlkey=qzf44rviccwt2ucwvpo86p8ie&dl=0).

### Week 1 Discussion

**YOUR POST :** Use the readings to answer the following questions.

1.  What's a research topic that you would be interested in learning more about? What is the variable that is the focus of this question? What are some of your past experiences that influence your interest or beliefs in this question?

2.  Summarize one bias from the Goldacre reading in your own words. And then think of a real-life example of where this bias might apply. If you use AI, I want to see some critical analysis / thought about what the AI wrote (e.g., is this correct? was this helpful?)

3.  How did the replication crisis in psychology make you feel (in a few words)? Had you heard about this before? What other questions do you have?

4.  **SCAVENGER HUNT.** Plan to come to our next class with a screenshot or link of an advertisement, promotion, or any kind of persuasive argument (memes count!) you see on the internet. Okay if you want to submit the assignment before you find this, but hopefully won't take too long since we are inundated with ads. Maybe take a few screenshots to share one with your buddy in case they forget too?

**REPLY TO ANOTHER STUDENT'S POST :** Consider the person's research topic - what is the AFFECT, BEHAVIOR, and COGNITIVE aspect of this variable? How might knowledge of this variable allow people to CONTROL outcomes in the world?

-   Choose the person who posted before you, or someone who doesn't have any replies yet. (First person to post can choose anyone.)
