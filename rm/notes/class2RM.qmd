[**Research for Fun and Profit**](https://catterson.github.io/ystats/chapters/2R_Data.html#part-3-research-for-fun-and-profit)**.** A summary of scientific articles - where researchers read (and write) about the research studies. Review the publication process, types of articles, the peer review process, and different methods of evaluating a research article.
2.  [**The Replication Crisis in Psychology**](https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-replication-crisis-in-psychology)**.** Focus on the definition of a replication, the reasons for non-replications, and some of the potential solutions to the problem.
3.  **OPTIONAL READINGS :** for those who would like to learn more. Let me know if you find other cool readings on these topics to add.
    -   [**More on the replication crisis in psychology**](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replication-crisis-peer-review-statistics). The article is now behind a paywall...but [here's a PDF of the article from the Internet Archive](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/21h3kcq6kc5jszo00fm6w/1_Vox_ReplicationCrisis_2020.pdf?rlkey=qzf44rviccwt2ucwvpo86p8ie&dl=0).

### Week 1 Discussion

**YOUR POST :** Use the readings to answer the following questions.

1.  What's a research topic that you would be interested in learning more about? What is the variable that is the focus of this question? What are some of your past experiences that influence your interest or beliefs in this question?

2.  Summarize one bias from the Goldacre reading in your own words. And then think of a real-life example of where this bias might apply. If you use AI, I want to see some critical analysis / thought about what the AI wrote (e.g., is this correct? was this helpful?)

3.  How did the replication crisis in psychology make you feel (in a few words)? Had you heard about this before? What other questions do you have?

4.  **SCAVENGER HUNT.**

**REPLY TO ANOTHER STUDENT'S POST :** Consider the person's research topic - what is the AFFECT, BEHAVIOR, and COGNITIVE aspect of this variable? How might knowledge of this variable allow people to CONTROL outcomes in the world?

-   Choose the person who posted before you, or someone who doesn't have any replies yet. (First person to post can choose anyone.)
