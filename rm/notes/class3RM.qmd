### Useful Links; Freed from Canvas

-   [Class Page](https://catterson.github.io/rm/RMDVC.html)
-   [Vision Board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14u3w5edvo6KSFRw2U9t1knDANFSGBWOvDjS7-ZGujos/edit?usp=sharing)

### Due Next Week before Class

1.  **Read the articles below.** Optional readings are not required; but lemme know if you read and have thoughts!
2.  **Complete Discussion 3**. Questions below, submit on Canvas.
3.  **Complete Reading Quiz 3**. on Canvas.

### Readings for Next Week (and Quiz 3)

1.  [**Objectivity Interrogations**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63236-z#Sec18). Professor hopefully passed out a physical copy of this in class where we did a quick read. Take a second pass and do a deeper reading of the article.

2.  [**Read about reliability and validity.**](https://catterson.github.io/ystats/chapters/4R_NormalPeople.html#part-3-good-data-validity-and-reliability)Focus on the main definition of reliability and validity, as well as the specific types. Then, watch the videos on phrenology, and how it failed tests of reliability and validity. Go ahead and do the check-in + watch the video review as practice for the quiz on these terms.

3.  **OPTIONAL :** For students looking for guidance (or more perspective) on reading research articles. TBH I wish I had read these in graduate school.

    -   [**How to Read a Paper**](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf). I like this article because it emphasizes that there are different layers to reading a paper. Use this paper to help you read the next one :)

    -   [**Ten simple rules for reading a scientific paper.**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7392212/). This article comes from a biology perspective, but has a nice overview of the different parts to a research paper, and some of the broader questions to consider.

### Week 3 Discussion Questions.

**YOUR POST :** Use the readings to answer the following questions. Please submit answers to the graded Canvas discussion post for the grade, but when prompted please also copy / paste your work to our [Vision Board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14u3w5edvo6KSFRw2U9t1knDANFSGBWOvDjS7-ZGujos/edit?usp=sharing) so we can more easily see this work together in class.

1.  **IN CLASS :** Start a literature review for a topic you would be interested in researching as a psychologist. Find at least three articles related to your topic, fill in the annotated bibliography (see class for a template), and [add a link to your annotated bibliography to the VISION BOARD (FINAL PROJECT tab)]{.underline}. Make sure anyone with the link can view, but you don't need to give folks edit permission, unless you want to.

2.  **CONTINUE THE JOURNEY :** do a more deep reading of the "Objectivity Interrogations." What was a sentence you liked? What was a sentence you found confusing, or what's a question you have about the reading? Have you ever experienced an objectivity interrogation? Also [include your answers to the WEEK THREE Vision Board topic]{.underline}.

3.  **LEARN ABOUT SCIENCE :** Read about reliability and validity, complete the check-in (practice quiz), and watch the video review. How'd you do? What questions do you have about these terms?

4.  **SCAVENGER HUNT :** think of something that measures you (e.g., a pedometer). Why and when do you use this tool? Do you trust it? Why / why not?

5.  **REPLY.** Ask another student (who doesn't yet have a reply) some authentic question about their research project or reaction to Objectivity Interrogation. An authentic question is something you actually want to know...can be anything related to the class.
