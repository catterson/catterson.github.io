# Part 1 : Operationalization is an Eight Syllable Word

-   What comes to mind when you see this word?

-   Say this word outloud.

## DEFINITION : Operationalization

-   A definition.

## Deep Breath. No Talking.

## ACTIVITY : Count the Interruptions. {.smaller}

**Count the Interruptions : [tinyurl.com/researchinterruptions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDt9g2s4rELaKorXyprVgtOa0Smb8ooI_FIWNg2i7iXKpazA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

-   Count the number of interruptions in the video (which professor will play soon).
-   Submit your answer, **then wait for the letter of the day.**

## BUDDY DISCUSSION

-   How was watching the video?

-   How many INTERRUPTIONS did you count?

-   How did you OPERATIONALIZE an INTERRUPTION? What are some ways we could strengthen this OPERATIONALIZATION?

-   Can you say OPERATIONALIZATION three times fast?

## CLASS DISCUSSION :

-   Clap if you and your buddy got the exact same number.

-   **This is a problem of...**

    -   inter-rater reliability
    -   test-retest reliability
    -   convergent validity
    -   discriminant validity
    -   face validity

-   What PREDICTIONS can we make about counting interruptions a second time?

## DISCUSS : the three rules of people watching

-   **the three rules :** which one is the most important?

-   

## DISCUSS : the three rules of people watching

-   Review of existing

-   Defining a SPAFF for an interruption.

## SPEAKING OF OBSERVATIONS...

-   Y'all observe me; department wants your feedback.
-   Why does college not trust professor's self-reports of their own teaching (we are great.)

## Discussion Questions

1.  **ON THE VISION BOARD : Look over the SPAFF DRAFT** that professor got started for the variable of "Interruption." Contribute at least ONE idea to the list (next to your name) from one of the following categories in the reading.

    -   What is the FUNCTION of the variable you observe?

    -   What are the INDICATORS of the variable?

    -   What are the PHYSICAL CUES of the variable?

    -   What are some COUNTER-INDICATORS for this variable that the person might define to avoid error in your observations?

2.  **REPLY TO ANOTHER STUDENT.** Look over their draft of the SPAFF rating scale. Help them revise at least one part of their behavioral coding guidelines to improve the validity of the observation.
