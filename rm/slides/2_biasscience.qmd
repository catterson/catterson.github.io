# Part 1 : Can Psychology Be a Valid Science?

## RECAP : Goal of Science to Predict & Control

### Some Example Research Questions {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Fiona :** "...how creativity changes in our minds as we grow older."

-   **London :** "As we age, why is it that we begin to naturally feel attracted to different aesthetic styles in our lives?"

-   **Aracely :** "how we interact with other people and how they influence us in different ways."

-   **Jake :** "how different age groups use AI chatbots like ChatGPT."
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Hypotheses** : falsifiable predictions based on your theory.

    -   H0 = null hypothesis = if the theory is NOT SUPPORTED, then I expect…

    -   HA, = alternative hypothesis = if the theory is SUPPORTED, then I expect...

### ACTIVITY :

-   [**RESEARCH METHODS VISION BOARD**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14u3w5edvo6KSFRw2U9t1knDANFSGBWOvDjS7-ZGujos/edit?usp=sharing)**.**

    -   Add your name, dream vacation, and write out your research question & theory (from D1).

    -   Define the Null & Alternative Hypotheses.

### DISCUSS : The Replication Crisis in Psychology{.smaller}

-   How did this make you feel? Why?

-   Why do you think so many students hadn't heard about the replication crisis until this class?

-   What ideas or solutions do you think would work?

-   Does this change your perspective on psychology as positivist?

    -   POSITIVISM : there is a REAL TRUTH about what makes people think, feel, and act that we can someday learn.

    -   POST-POSITIVISM : reality exists, but we may not be able to ever understand REAL TRUTH because our ability to study reality will always be influenced by people.

-   What other questions do you have?

# Part 2 : Cognitive Biases
