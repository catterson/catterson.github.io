# Part 2 : Data Analysis in R {.smaller}

## Loading the Reading Data

## Graphing a Variable in R

## Learning from a Variable with Human Brain

## ACTIVITY : Learn About People with R and Human Brain

-   Choose another variable from the dataset.

-   Graph the variable and run some descriptive statistics.

    -   What are the numbers?

    -   What do these numbers tell you about the people in the dataset?

    -   What other questions do you have?

-   **Type in the [RESEARCH METHODS VISION BOARD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14u3w5edvo6KSFRw2U9t1knDANFSGBWOvDjS7-ZGujos/edit?usp=sharing).**

## PRESENTATIONS : {.smaller}

# NEXT WEEK : Observations

-   **I'm being observed!** Great if we can all show up on time :)

-   

## 

## TO DO :

-   Read about observational data.

-   Read a specific coding scheme researchers use to

## BYE.
