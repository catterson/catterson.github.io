::: {.column width="70%"}
**Validity : Are we measuring the TRUTH?**

-   **convergent :** our measure should be related to things it should be related to.

-   **discriminant :** our measure should be UNrelated to things it should be UNrelated to.

**Reliability : Are we getting repeatable measures?**

-   **test-retest :** multiple tests with the same measure should yield the same result (if the subject did not change.)

-   **inter-rater :** multiple measures should yield the same result

# Part 2 : Data Analysis in R {.smaller}

## Getting Started in Six Easy Steps.

1.  Take a deep breath.

2.  Download the R Activity Document (under Useful Links) to your computer.

3.  Upload this to posit.cloud, and open it in posit.cloud by clicking on the file (it is a fancy R Script).

## The Dataset {.smaller}

```{r}
codebookurl <- "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/m4os7p2jualfzzuyqbnqy/CODEBOOK_ReadingData.csv?rlkey=wteyc27f8vgo6ihe05hijnkln&dl=1"
dataurl <- "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/47gw0h2x6abprskwdqgo7/DATASET_ReadingData.csv?rlkey=4mm3itw9p4fm7ee5qa7z3n82q&dl=1"

d <- read.csv(dataurl, stringsAsFactors = T)
codebook <- read.csv(codebookurl)
knitr::kable(codebook)
```

## Graphing a Variable in R

What do you observe about the graph below?

```{r}
#| column: margin
barplot(table(d$like), 
        col = "black", bor = "white", 
        xlab = "I Like Reading for Fun",
        ylab = "Frequency")

```

## Learning from a Variable with Human and Statistics Brain

What do you observe about the graph below, in terms of the following statisitcs???

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
```{r}
#| output-location: column
statz <- t(psych::describe(d$like)[,c(2:5, 8)])
colnames(statz) <- ""
statz
```
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
```{r}
#| output-location: column
barplot(table(d$like), 
        col = "black", bor = "white", 
        xlab = "I Like Reading for Fun",
        ylab = "Frequency")

```

## ACTIVITY : Learn About People with R and Human Brain

-   Choose another variable from the dataset.

-   Graph the variable and run some descriptive statistics.

    -   What are the numbers?

    -   What do these numbers tell you about the people in the dataset?

    -   What other questions do you have?

-   **Type in the [RESEARCH METHODS VISION BOARD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14u3w5edvo6KSFRw2U9t1knDANFSGBWOvDjS7-ZGujos/edit?usp=sharing).**

## STUDENT PRESENTATIONS? {.smaller}

# NEXT WEEK : Observations

-   **I'm being observed!** Great if we can all show up on time :)

-   Read about observational data.

-   Read a specific coding scheme researchers use to

## BYE.
