## Announcements

1.  **Final Project**
    -   Define a dataset \[Milestone 1!\]
    -   [Pre-register your analyses](https://aspredicted.org)
        -   Forgot to instruct y'all to do this!
        -   Goals of Pre-registration :
            -   Think carefully and clearly about your dataset (outliers, measures, models)
            -   Be consistent in your analyses; keep things simple.
            -   When you deviate from your analysis plan, that's okay! You are learning and exploring. Just good to recognize and state this.
2.  **This is Not an Exam**
    -   Discussed at the End of Class!
    -   Will be chill? I hope. There's a rubric that emphasizes *trying.*
3.  **The End Is Near.**
    -   4/18 : Multilevel Models (MORE LINES)
    -   4/25 : Exam Recap + More on Multilevel Models
    -   5/2 : Conclusion (The Learning Has Stopped; Would You Like to Know More?)

## Multilevel Models (MLM) : Conceptual Understanding

### Definition

-   Multilevel Models (MLM)

    -   Hierarchical linear models, mixed effects models, random effects models, etc.

    -   MODELS MODELS MODELS : It's just a line! Lots of lines. (Lots of lines models?)

### The Formulas

-   **The Linear Model Equation**

$$\huge y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_kx_k + \epsilon$$

-   **The MLM Equation (Composite Notation)**

    -   Random Intercept : $$\large y_{ij} = (\beta_0 + \gamma_{0j} + u_{0j}) + \beta_{1j}x_{1ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$$
    -   Random Intercept and Random Slope : $$\large y_{ij} = (\beta_0 + \gamma_{0j} + u_{0j}) + (\beta_{1j}x_{1ij} + \gamma_{1j})+ \epsilon_{ij}$$

-   **The MLM Equation (Level Notation)**

### Why Are We Doing This?

1.  **The Assumption of Independence Has Been Violated! (MLM increases our power and reliability as scientists.)**
    -   Multiple measures of an individual gives you a more reliable estimate of what and who they are.
    -   A person serves as their own control; examining how an individual changes over time (as a result of some other variable or an experimental manipulation)
2.  **Better than a purely "fixed effects" approach.**
    -   While we *could* just account for group variation by adding this to our model as dummy-coded group identifiers...
    -   ...the MLM results in a simpler model (less coefficients; we just allow the intercepts and slopes to vary)
3.  **Model more complex phenomenon.**
    -   How people change over time (within-person variation).
    -   Simpson's Paradox
    -   Other Examples?

## How Do We Do This in R?

#### Example 1 : The Sleep Dataset

From the `?sleep` dataset; "Data which show the effect of two soporific drugs (increase in hours of sleep compared to control)."

-   Extra : increase in hours of sleep
-   Group : drug given (1 = control; 2 = drug)
-   ID : patient ID

##### The Linear Model (a "Between Person" Study)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(sleep, aes(y = extra, x = group)) + 
  geom_point(size=2) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, color = 'red', size = 1.25, linewidth = 2)

lmod <- lm(extra ~ as.factor(group), data = sleep)
summary(lmod)
```

##### The Linear Model, with ID as a grouping factor (a "Within-Person" Study)

Many linear models! Look at the graph below. What's going on? What do you observe? How might this help us understand the relationship between these two variables?

```{r}
ggplot(sleep, aes(y = extra, x = group, color = ID)) + 
  geom_point(size=2) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = ID), linewidth = 0.75)
```

Random Intercepts : Still just one equation. But a lot more lines!

```{r}
#install.packages("lme4")
library(lme4)
mlmod <- lmer(extra ~ as.factor(group) + (1 | ID), data = sleep)
summary(mlmod)
```

-   **Fixed Effects :** The "Average" across all the grouping variables. Our friend the linear model!

    -   Intercept : ????

    -   Slope : ????

    -   Correlation of Fixed Effects : How our intercept and slope are related to each other. ?????

-   **Random Effects :**

    -   ICC = Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = how much the variation in our grouping variable (here : subject) explains total variation.

    -   To calculate : take variance of intercept / total variance

        ```{r}
        2.8483 / (2.8483 + 0.7564)
        ```

    -   OR :

        ```{r}
        library(performance)
        icc(mlmod)
        ```

**More about those random effects.** We can examine them for the individuals in the study. They are adjustments to the intercept (people start with different baselines of sleep.)

```{r}
fixef(mlmod)
ranef(mlmod)
var(ranef(mlmod)$ID)
```

##### But Professor, Where are the S\*\*\*s???

By default, lmer does not run statistical tests. I heard this was because the author of the package was philosophically opposed to them, but I think it's also because there are [continued debates](https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#why-doesnt-lme4-display-denominator-degrees-of-freedomp-values-what-other-options-do-i-have) about how best to calculate and interpret p-values for statistics that, by definition, can vary.

You can report confidence intervals from the results of the lmer model.

```{r}
confint(mlmod)
```

However, if you really want the stars, there's another package that adds the stars, and gives some other useful features.

```{r}
#install.packages("lmerTest")
library(lmerTest) # note that the function lmer from package lme4 has been masked.
mlmod <- lmer(extra ~ as.factor(group) + (1 | ID), data = sleep) # the same model; same equation
summary(mlmod) # new output!
ranova(mlmod) # a way to test whether inclusion of random effect improves the model fit or not.
detach("package:lmerTest") # won't be using this?
```

##### A Neat Thing : The "Paired T-Test" is Just a Narrow Form of the MLM

```{r}
d <- sleep # copying the data
sleepwide <- data.frame(d[1:10,1], d[11:20,1]) # moving into wide format
names(sleepwide) <- c("Extra1", "Extra2") # renaming variables
sleepwide # new data; in the "wide" format.
t.test(sleepwide$Extra1, sleepwide$Extra2, paired = T) # comparing mean of T1 to mean of T2, assuming a paired distribution....
```

##### What About Random Slopes?

For random intercepts and random slopes : Still just one equation....but....too many lines for the model to converge.

```{r}
#mlmod2 <- lmer(extra ~ as.factor(group) + (group | ID), data = sleep)
```

#### Example 2 : Another Sleep Dataset

The classic teaching dataset from lmer. Hooray!

```{r}
?sleepstudy
```

**A Question :** Is there a relationship between number of days of sleep deprivation and reaction time?

#### The Graph

How might we graph this in ggplot?

```{r}

```

#### Interpreting the Model (Random Intercepts)

What model would we define?

```{r}

```

How do we interpret the results of this model?

#### Interpreting the Model (Random Intercepts and Slopes)

What model would we define?

```{r}

```

How do we interpret the results of this model?
