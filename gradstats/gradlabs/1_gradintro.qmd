## Why Statistics in Psychology??

Why is this class required?

### Psychology as a Science

### Statistics as a Language

### R is a Programming Language

#### The Console

-   The console is where R does its work.

-   **ACTIVTY :** open up R and type some MATH into the console. Yeah! You are programming!!!

#### R Studio and the Source File (.R)

In this class, I'll be using RStudio. RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that includes the console along with other useful windows and tools.

-   **The Console** is at the bottom left of the IDE. Hi console!
-   **The R script** is at the top left of the IDE, and is a document that you use to write (and organize) code. You will want to do most of your work in the R script, and feel an appropriate level of anxiety when you notice that your Rscript is unsaved (as indicated by the red text and \*).
-   **The Environment** is at the top right of the IDE, and shows you all of the "objects" that you have defined in R.
-   **The** **File Window** is at the bottom right of the IDE, and shows you the files. Note that there are tabs here for Plots (where graphs will pop up), Packages (things you can download to give R extra features), a Help viewer (sometimes very useful!).
