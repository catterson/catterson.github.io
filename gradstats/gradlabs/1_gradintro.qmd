-   **Science is....**

    -   Description : The topics of your research interests!

    -   Prediction : An educated guess you have about the future.

    -   Power : How you use this knowledge (and predictions) to exert influence over the world / your future.

        -   Rosaline : predicting how adverse childhood experiences lead to negative outcomes for kids...and then identify those triggers and try to prevent them from happening; developing effective interventions.

        -   Ann : children and adolescents with ADHD & epilepsy have lower psychological adjustments; prediction about what can improve psychological adjustment –\> improved outcomes.

## Introductions to R (a Programming Language)

### The Console

The console is where R does its work.

-   **ACTIVITY :** Look at the image below. What do you see? What makes sense / what seems confusing?

### ![](images/clipboard-3010296644.png){width="449"}

-   **ACTIVTY :** open up R and type some MATH into the console. Yeah! You are programming!!!

### R Studio and the Source File (.R)

In this class, we'll be using RStudio. RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that includes the console along with other useful windows and tools.

-   **The Console** is at the bottom left of the IDE. Hi console!
-   **The R script** is at the top left of the IDE, and is a document that you use to write (and organize) code. You will want to do most of your work in the R script, and feel an appropriate level of anxiety when you notice that your Rscript is unsaved (as indicated by the red text and \*).
-   **The Environment** is at the top right of the IDE, and shows you all of the "objects" that you have defined in R.
-   **The** **File Window** is at the bottom right of the IDE, and shows you the files. Note that there are tabs here for Plots (where graphs will pop up), Packages (things you can download to give R extra features), a Help viewer (sometimes very useful!).

### Working in an R Script

[**Here's a link to an RScript!**](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/568tanzamnpsqf2udt4xc/1_RBasics.R?rlkey=4kl8x4a3iyjbrdyzlkf58ca84&dl=0)You can download this to your computer, and open it in RStudio.

**Topics We Will Review**

-   **math :** common operators and functions

-   **variables :** string and numeric vectors

-   **datasets :** data.frame(); datasets::

-   **functions :** descriptive statistics, base graphics, generating random numbers

-   **good code :** troubleshooting errors; naming datasets; white space; keeping code and files organized

## Is there time left? A fun R demonstration :)

### The [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

### Use R to simulate the Monty Hall Problem.

You'll need to use the following bits of code :

``` r
variable <- c("") # create a string variable (for the options)
sample() # to "randomly" sample from this variable
setdiff() # to differentiate 
```

You're welcome to try this on your own, but below are steps to help guide your work if you'd like (and some extra hints if you'd like more specific instructions.)

Totally okay if you struggle with this! The point is to try and do something fun (and potentially challenging) in R, and see how computers can be used to address research questions.

1.  Define the options to choose from (three doors)

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### HINT

Create a string variable with three options : door1, door2, and door3
:::

2.  Define player choice and treasure location.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### HINT

use the sample() function to define two variables named choice and treasure; each a random door.
:::

3.  Define what doors Monty can open.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### HINT

Use the setdiff() function to identify all the doors that are not what the player chose or where the treasure is.
:::

4.  Define what Monty *does* open.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### HINT

Use the sample function to select one random door from the variable that defines what doors Monty can open.
:::

5.  What happens if we switch?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### HINT

Define a new variable that identifies the choice if we switch; this should selects one random option from the list of doors that are NOT what Monty opened or what the player initially chose. NOTE : You will need to use the sample and setdiff functions together.
:::

6.  Test whether the player won or not.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### HINT

Use the if-else function to define a "WIN" as whether the choice variable matches the treasure variable. Then repeat this step for whether the switch choice variable matches the treasure variable.
:::

7.  Repeat these steps 1000 times.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### HINT

Define an empty array to save the result of each test. Then define a for-loop to simulate the Monty Hall 1000 times.
