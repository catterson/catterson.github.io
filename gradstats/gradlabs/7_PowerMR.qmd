## [check-in : interpreting linear models.](https://forms.gle/oMAWEBCEENoGTFFV8)

**Load [this dataset into R](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1vx0orxloeteo6tjkylz0/undergradsarepeople.csv?rlkey=sb0jtcmcydjit7x85l3tyoh72&dl=0). Collected from undergrads at UC Berkeley. Yay students.**

```{r}
#| include: false
u <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/!GRADSTATS/gradlab/Datasets/undergradsarepeople.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
```

-   The researchers wanted to know whether people who ate breakfast (IV = breakfast; a categorical factor with two levels 0 = No; 1 = Yes) would happier (DV = happy) than people who did not have breakfast.
-   Use the R output from the linear model below to answer the following questions :

```{r}
hist(u$happy)
plot(u$breakfast)
levels(u$breakfast)[1]# identifying the empty level.
levels(u$breakfast)[1] <- NA
plot(u$breakfast)
mod1 <- lm(happy ~ breakfast, data = u)
summary(mod1)
```

1.  What is the difference in happiness for someone who did vs. did not eat breakfast? \[.53\]

2.  What is the predicted happiness for someone who did not eat breakfast? (Round to 1 decimal place.)

    ````         
    ```         
    happiness = 7 + .5 * 0 = 7
    ```
    ````

3.  What is the predicted happiness for someone who did eat breakfast? (Round to 1 decimal place.)

    ````         
    ```         
    happiness = 7 + .5 * 1 = 7.5
    ```
    ````

4.  What are some reasons we might we observe this difference?

    -   CAUSAL : having breakfast makes people feel good

    -   REVERSE CAUSASTION : happiness causes you to eat breakfast (not being happy causes you to not eat breakfast.)

    -   CONFOUNDS & COLLIDERS :

        -   CONFOUNDS : a variable that is related to both the DV and the IV (free time is related to both happiness and ability to have breakfast; stress; SES statsus; age)

        -   INTERACTION EFFECT \[NEXT WEEK\] : a variable that is an outcome of both the DV and IV.

            -   example : inherent talent \~ hard work; but in a sample of high-performing people, these are related. but in a sample of low-performing people, these two groups are not related.

    -   CHANCE : the relationship is due to sampling error.

5.  Is this difference considered statistically significant? Why / why not?

6.  Now, use R to define a linear model to test whether people with more instagram followers (IV = insta.followers) would be happier (DV = happy) than people with fewer instagram followers. What is the slope of this model? Round to two decimal places.

7.  Describe this relationship between these two variables in terms of the slope, R\^2 value, and statistical significance.

```{r}
hist(u$insta.followers)
mod2 <- lm(happy ~ insta.followers, data = u)
summary(mod2)
plot(happy ~ insta.followers, data = u)
abline(mod2, lwd = 5)
dev.new()
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(mod2)


u$insta.followers[u$insta.followers > 10000] <- NA
mod2 <- lm(happy ~ insta.followers, data = u)
summary(mod2)
plot(happy ~ insta.followers, data = u)
abline(mod2, lwd = 5)
dev.new()
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(mod2)
```

## power tests

### what's the point, professor?

-   **Power :** the probability that you would "correctly" observe a "true" relationship between two variables that exists.

    -   **goal :** you want power to be HIGH. Power increases as...

        -   **the effect size increases :** the bigger the difference, the more likely you'll detect it.

        -   **your sample size increases :** the more people, the less sampling error, and the easier it is to have conidence that any difference you found is not just chance.

        -   **you increase the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis :** if the probability

    -   **assumptions :** there is a true relationship; you have observed this relationship.

-   **Reasons to Calculate Power :**

    -   **Post-Hoc Power :** You did a study, and want to evaluate

    -   **Power Planning :** You are planning to run a study, and want to know how many people to recruit to have the highest probability of observing the "true" effect (if it exists.)

### a tour of null and alternative realities

### calculating in R (by hand)

```{r}
mod1 # a model object
summary(mod1) # a function applied to the object
sm1 <- summary(mod1) # saving this as an object
objects(sm1) # there is more inside.
sm1$coefficients # tadaa

sm1$coefficients[2,3] # our t-value
m1tval <- sm1$coefficients[2,3]

qt(.975, df = 147) # t-distribution approaches the normal distribution (with a 95% Interval cutoff of 1.96....) but we are not quite there.
m1cut <- qt(.975, 147) # t-distribution approaches the normal distribution (with a 95% Interval cutoff of 1.96....) but we are not quite there.

pt(m1tval - m1cut, df = 147) # our power.
```

### calculating in R (a package)

```{r}
# install.packages("pwr")
library(pwr)
summary(mod1)
m1r <- summary(mod1)$r.squared^.5
pwr.r.test(n = 149, r = m1r)
```

### more power examples!

#### Power Illustrated.
In lecture, professor did some scribbles on the whiteboard to illustrate power, and tried to record these. He also said that he would record a few other videos.

Prof. did not, in fact, find time in the present moment to record new videos. Bummer! But he did remember that he had recorded similar videos, and found some from 2018. (What were you doing in 2018?? Let us know on Discord; and as always - reach out if you still have questions about power!!)

-   [Recording #1 : Conceptual Example of Power](https://www.loom.com/share/f393327465f54f3cbf5bbe8c349e3a2e?sid=45f72b59-894e-4d8d-a977-254d6e52f5c4)
-   [Recording #2 : Another Example](https://www.loom.com/share/62440c2754cd4874a22ef2f00618eaff). Couldn't immediately track down the original data analyses these refer to, but the slope (b = .44) and other statistics come from a paper I had rejected in part because reviewers complained that I only replicated the main result in 4 out of 5 studies. (The paper was also a hot mess.) Bummer! But it was a cool phenomenon; I sadly never published on it (parenting * teaching career activated), but truth got out eventually someone published a very clearly written, much better, and perfectly replicating paper (across six studies!) on it 8 years later. Ahhh, one thing off the to-do list!

#### Estimating Sample Size.
As discussed in the lecture slides (see recording), power is a function of effect size, sample size, and the alpha level (alpha = the Type I error that the researcher sets). This means that you can use these functions to estimate the sample size you need for a given power (the convention is often 80%).

Let's say I want to know what sample size I need to detect a slope of r = .23.

From the `pwr` package, I can define this effect, specifcy the power, type I error level, and whether I want to do a 1- or 2-tailed test.

```{r}
pwr.r.test(r = .23, power = .80, alternative = "two.sided")
```
I can also plot the result of this output and see how power increases as a function of my sample size.

```{r}
p.ex <- pwr.r.test(r = .23, power = .80, alternative = "two.sided")
plot(p.ex)
```

### ...but you don't have to take my word for it.
The approach to power described above assumes a normally distribution of sampling error. This is a good starting place, but not all distributions are gaussian! Below are a few different methods to help you estimate power across a wide variety of types of data.

-   [Here's a nice overview of how to conduct sample size power analysis in R; it works through a few examples and discusses how to ](https://rpubs.com/mbounthavong/sample_size_power_analysis_R)
-   [This is a modern, thorough, and good overview of power, that also discusses ways to generate simulated data to estimate power.](https://aaroncaldwell.us/SuperpowerBook/introduction-to-power-analysis.html).
-   [Here's another tutorial of an R package that works for a wide variety of different tests; many of which can be used when youthe assumptions of linear regression are violated.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwrss/vignettes/examples.html)
-   Let me know if you find other useful resources to help calcualte or conceptualize power!

## more regression (multiple regression)

### Benefits of Multiple Regression: Life is Complex!

1.  Account for multiple variables to help predict and explain the DV.
2.  Control for the effect of on IV on the relationship between another IV and the DV.
3.  Compare unique effects of each IV on the DV. See how the slope of one IV compares to the slope of another IV. (*Need to standardize your variables, to make sure that they are all on the same scale.*)
4.  **NEXT WEEK : Interaction Effects!!!** See how the relationship between one IV and the DV changes depending on another IV.

### In Practice.

```{r}
u$height[u$height > 85 | u$height < 20] <- NA
levels(u$long.hair)[1] <- NA
levels(u$is.female)[1] <- NA
library(gplots)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plotmeans(height ~ long.hair, data = u, ylim = c(60,70)) 
plotmeans(height ~ is.female, data = u, ylim = c(60,70))
```

::: panel-tabset
#### Height \~ long.hair

```{r}
moda <- lm(height ~ long.hair, data = u)
summary(moda)
```

#### Height \~ is.female

```{r}
modb <- lm(height ~ is.female, data = u)
summary(modb)
```

#### height \~ long.hair + is.female

```{r}
modc <- lm(height ~ long.hair + is.female, data = u)
summary(modc)
```
:::

#### Discussion : What Do You Observe Changing About the Slopes?

### Reporting Effects in a Regression Table (see Sierra review in Discussion Section!!!)

**Table 1.** Unstandardized Regression Coefficients; Predicting Height from Long.Hair and Is.Female.

|                             | Model 1 | Model 2 | Model 3 |
|-----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Intercept                   |         |         |         |
| Long.Hair (0 = No; 1 = Yes) |         |         |         |
| Is.Female (0 = No; 1 = Yes) |         |         |         |
| $R^2$                       |         |         |         |

### Multiple Regression : Visualized in Multi-Dimensional Space!

The code below won't run in quarto, and may not work on your comptuer; for teaching purposes!

``` r

#install.packages('rgl')
#install.packages('car')
library(car)
library(rgl)

scatter3d(as.numeric(u$is.female), # IV1 - must be numeric (if not already)
          u$height, # DV
          as.numeric(u$long.hair)) # IV2 - must be numeric (if not already)
```
