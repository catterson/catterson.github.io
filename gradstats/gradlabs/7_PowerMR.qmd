## [check-in : interpreting linear models.](https://forms.gle/oMAWEBCEENoGTFFV8)

**Load [this dataset into R](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1vx0orxloeteo6tjkylz0/undergradsarepeople.csv?rlkey=sb0jtcmcydjit7x85l3tyoh72&dl=0). Collected from undergrads at UC Berkeley. Yay students.**

```{r}
#| include: false
u <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/!GRADSTATS/gradlab/Datasets/undergradsarepeople.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
levels(u$breakfast)[1] <- NA
```

-   The researchers wanted to know whether people who ate breakfast (IV = breakfast; a categorical factor with two levels 0 = No; 1 = Yes) would happier (DV = happy) than people who did not have breakfast. 
-   Use the R output from the linear model below to answer the following questions :

```{r}
mod1 <- lm(happy ~ breakfast, data = u)
summary(mod1)
```
1.  What is the difference in happiness for someone who did vs. did not eat breakfast?
2.  What is the predicted happiness for someone who did not eat breakfast? (Round to 1 decimal place.)
3.  What is the predicted happiness for someone who did eat breakfast?  (Round to 1 decimal place.)
4.  What are some reasons we might we observe this difference?
5.  Is this difference considered statistically significant? Why / why not?
6.  Now, use R to define a linear model to test whether people with more instagram followers (IV = insta.followers) would be happier (DV = happy) than people with fewer instagram followers. What is the slope of this model? Round to two decimal places.
7. Describe this relationship between these two variables in terms of the slope, R^2 value, and statistical significance.

```{r}

```


## power tests

### what's the point, professor?

-   **Power :** the probability that you would "correctly" observe a "true" relationship between two variables that exists.

    -   **goal :** you want power to be HIGH. Power increases as...

        -   **the effect size increases :** the bigger the difference, the more likely you'll detect it.

        -   **your sample size increases :** the more people, the less sampling error, and the easier it is to have conidence that any difference you found is not just chance.

        -   **you increase the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis :** if the probability

    -   **assumptions :** there is a true relationship; you have observed this relationship.

-   **Reasons to Calculate Power :**

    -   **Post-Hoc Power :** You did a study, and want to evaluate

    -   **Power Planning :** You are planning to run a study, and want to know how many people to recruit to have the highest probability of observing the "true" effect (if it exists.)

### conceptual understanding

### calculating in R (by hand)

```{r}
mod1 # a model object
summary(mod1) # a function applied to the object
sm1 <- summary(mod1) # saving this as an object
objects(sm1) # there is more inside.
sm1$coefficients # tadaa

sm1$coefficients[2,3] # our t-value
m1tval <- sm1$coefficients[2,3]

qt(.975, df = 147) # t-distribution approaches the normal distribution (with a 95% Interval cutoff of 1.96....) but we are not quite there.
m1cut <- qt(.975, 147) # t-distribution approaches the normal distribution (with a 95% Interval cutoff of 1.96....) but we are not quite there.

pt(m1tval - m1cut, df = 147) # our power.
```

### calculating in R (a package)

```{r}
# install.packages("pwr")
library(pwr)
summary(mod1)
m1r <- summary(mod1)$r.squared^.5
pwr.r.test(n = 149, r = m1r)
```

This is the basic approach to power; most people do some version of this. But if you'd like a more thorough review of different methods of estimating power (and doing so via simulated data), [this seems like a modern, thorough, and good overview](https://aaroncaldwell.us/SuperpowerBook/introduction-to-power-analysis.html).

## more regression (multiple regression)

### Benefits of Multiple Regression: Life is Complex!

1.  Account for multiple variables to help predict and explain the DV.
2.  Control for the effect of on IV on the relationship between another IV and the DV.
3.  Compare unique effects of each IV on the DV. See how the slope of one IV compares to the slope of another IV. (*Need to standardize your variables, to make sure that they are all on the same scale.*)
4.  **NEXT WEEK : Interaction Effects!!!** See how the relationship between one IV and the DV changes depending on another IV.

### In Practice.

```{r}
u$height[u$height > 85 | u$height < 20] <- NA
levels(u$long.hair)[1] <- NA
levels(u$is.female)[1] <- NA
library(gplots)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plotmeans(height ~ long.hair, data = u, ylim = c(60,70)) 
plotmeans(height ~ is.female, data = u, ylim = c(60,70))
```

::: panel-tabset
#### Height \~ long.hair

```{r}
moda <- lm(height ~ long.hair, data = u)
summary(moda)
```

#### Height \~ is.female

```{r}
modb <- lm(height ~ is.female, data = u)
summary(modb)
```

#### height \~ long.hair + is.female

```{r}
modc <- lm(height ~ long.hair + is.female, data = u)
summary(modc)
```

#### Discussion : What Do You Observe Changing About the Slopes?

### Reporting Effects in a Regression Table

**Table 1.** Unstandardized Regression Coefficients; Predicting Height from Long.Hair and Is.Female.

|                             | Model 1 | Model 2 | Model 3 |
|-----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Intercept                   |         |         |         |
| Long.Hair (0 = No; 1 = Yes) |         |         |         |
| Is.Female (0 = No; 1 = Yes) |         |         |         |
| $R^2$                       |         |         |         |

### Multiple Regression : Visualized in Multi-Dimensional Space!

``` R
# This Code won't run in quarto, and may not work on your comptuer; for teaching purposes!
#install.packages('rgl')
#install.packages('car')
library(car)
library(rgl)

scatter3d(as.numeric(u$is.female), # IV1 - must be numeric (if not already)
          u$height, # DV
          as.numeric(u$long.hair)) # IV2 - must be numeric (if not already)
```

## lab 7.

1.  Get more practice working with multiple regression, and calculating power (both post-hoc and for power planning purposes).
2.  Recreate some of the analyses from the "Interrogating Objectivity" paper.
