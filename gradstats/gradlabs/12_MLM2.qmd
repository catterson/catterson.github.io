## [Check-In : Multilevel Models (MLM)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmtiyG6zXo_pgGLYempKtsyWhZdWDENCQYCCmHKuQ1sTdLuQ/viewform?usp=header)

-   Some code is below that I will run, but we won't see the output of.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| results: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(lme4)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

## Dataset : Wide Format
dw <- read.csv("~/Desktop/grad_class_wide.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)

## Converting Wide to Long Format
dl <- dw %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(starts_with("HowGoing"), starts_with("LoveR")),
    names_to = c(".value", "Timepoint"),
    names_pattern = "(HowGoing|LoveR)(\\d+)"
  )
dl <- dl[,c(1, 12:14)]
d <- dl

## Some Data Cleaning
d$Username <- as.factor(d$Username)
d$Timepoint <- as.numeric(d$Timepoint)
```

-   Okay, it's modeling time.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
## Plotting Data
ggplot(d, aes(y = HowGoing, x = Timepoint)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  facet_wrap(~Username) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, colour = "red", size = 1.25)

## MLM
mlm <- lmer(HowGoing ~ (1 | Username), data = d)
mlm2 <- lmer(HowGoing ~ Timepoint + (1 | Username), data = d)
mlm3 <- lmer(HowGoing ~ Timepoint + (Timepoint | Username), data = d)

summary(mlm3)

```

-   Check-In Stuff stops here.

### Some More Thoughts and Comments on MLM

-   Converting Data from Wide to Long

    -   **Wide Format :** Each repeated measure is its own column; each row is an individual.

        ![](images/clipboard-2798629359.png)

    -   **Long Format :** Each row is an individual observation; each column is a variable.

        -   **fixed effects :** repeat across rows (e.g., username; demographic & personality and other *between-person* variables)

        -   **random effects :** change across rows (e.g., mood; emotion; reaction times; other *within-person* variables)

            ![](images/clipboard-2900539411.png){width="185"}

    -   **Often need to convert wide to long;** it's a pain. Professor Used ChatGPT for This :( and it was easier :)

-   **Reporting the Results of MLM : It Gets Complicated**

    -   What fixed vs. random effects to include?

    -   Random effects can be averaged into fixed effects, and both can be included in the model.

        -   a person's mood varies over the day (random effect)

        -   the person's mood tends to be higher than another person's (fixed effect)

```{r}
# the modelsummary function : https://francish.net/mlmusingr/MLM_Appendix_A.pdf
# install.packages("modelsummary")
library(modelsummary)
modelsummary(list("Random Intercept Model" = mlm, "Random Intercept\nFixed Slope Model" = mlm2, "Random Intercept\nRandom Slope Model" = mlm3), 
             stars = TRUE,
             title = "Multilevel Model Regression Example")
```

## Not an Exam Debrief

### Activity and Discussion : Debrief of Team Work

-   [**One Dataset (and Psych 205 Assignment)**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qGXXwLUf7fiEKhhJ5ur-FkNUHDyLfrhjdPcSosrsAZw/edit?usp=sharing)

    -   **Our Class Analyses**

    -   [**29 Teams; 61 Analysts**](https://osf.io/qix4g/files/osfstorage) **:** Each team did what y'all did.

-   **Activity : Round Robin Peer Review**

    -   [**Step 1 :** Visit this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Ftod8PNXqlYVVTQ5a1ImtbXary4vIIMpfPwQv3zG2E/edit?usp=sharing)

    -   **Step 2 :** Find your name; share your early ATHLETIC EXPERIENCES (growth mindset etc. etc.); then use the [OSF LINK HERE](https://osf.io/qix4g/files/osfstorage) to find your Assigned Team's report.

    -   **Step 3 :** Skim / review the report; fill out the columns for the below questions.

        -   **Data Cleaning This Team Did for Red Card Variable.**

            -   Was this what you did? Something similar? Radically different? Something you've never heard of and might want to look into later?

        -   **Data Cleaning This Team Did for Race Variable.**

        -   **Type of Model They Used**.

        -   **What was the effect (was darker skin related to more or less red cards? Was this significant?)**

        -   **Questions or Comments You Had About The Team's Approach** (e.g., what would you want / need to learn more about? Was there something cool they did that we should know about?)

    -   **Step 4 :** Work with the members of your table to share your knowledge.

        -   What did the assigned team you read about do and find?

        -   What did you do and find?

        -   What changes might you make to your own analyses based on what others have done?

## Next Week : Final Project Draft (and PIZZA)

-   **Put together a summary graph (or table) that illustrates some of the main ideas.** If there was ONE PAGE to show people about your project, what would you put on that page?

    -   Make it something people WANT to look at and can LEARN from.

    -   No tiny font and giant margins!

    -   People will remember 1-2 things about your project (± 2).

-   **Bring whatever you have :)** but be prepared to chat about your data and project and get feedback.

-   **Psych department is paying (~*says they will reimburse me*~) for a PIZZA PARTY.**
