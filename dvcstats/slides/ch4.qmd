## Check-In Review

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: false
d <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/!WHY STATS/Class Datasets/214 - Class Datasets/Mini Data/mini_DATA.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
nrow(d)
hist(d$hrs.sleep)
sd(d$hrs.sleep)
mean(d$height)
hist(d$height)
mean(d$height[d$height > 20])

Follow along with professor's R Script for this week.

1.  **The R Stuff :** graphs, descriptive statistics (standard deviation), and outliers?!
2.  **The Brain Stuff :** "normal" distributions.
3.  **Questions, Concerns, Comments?** What feels hard or confusing? A moment of pause.
:::

## Lab 4. Continued Practice

1.  Choose two numeric variables from the dataset. Graph each variable variables side-by-side using the par() function. Make sure the variables look nice, and remove any outliers.
2.  Report the descriptive statistics for each variable. Then, explain what each variable tells you about the individuals in the dataset.
3.  Describe what additional questions you have about each variable.

## Quarto : Why are we learning this?

-   **It's a Fancy RScript :**

-   **An authentic skill :** professor (and others) use because it saves trouble of screenshotting by integrating code and text together in one document.

-   **WARNING :** professor still gets frustrated when using quarto. If you are feeling dread / maxxed out, then just use an Rscript + screenshot method. Okay?
