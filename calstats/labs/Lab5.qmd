For Lab 5, take last semester's [Mini R Exam](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2kz1AyiAvlWRx4mlNcqkI7NwCHr3Bldl4ryFXwdB2c/edit?usp=sharing). There's a key posted for this, but you should try to work on the exam on your own, and use the key as a guide / learning experience after getting stuck for a few minutes :)

Upload your completed practice exam to receive credit. Note you will not receive feedback from your TA, so make sure to look over the key.
