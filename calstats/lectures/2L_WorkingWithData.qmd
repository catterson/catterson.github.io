## Agenda

-   **3:10 - 3:20.** Check-In & Review

-   **3:20 - 4:00.** No stats in this class.

-   **4:00 - 4:10. BREAK TIME #1**

-   **4:10 - 5:00.** R in this class (loading data & graphing variables)

-   **5:00 - 5:05. Break Time #2**

-   **5:05 - 5:30.** Operationalization, Construct, and Measurement, Oh My!

-   **5:30 - 6:00.** Wrap Up & Questions About Grad School.

## Announcements

-   **DISCORD IS BUMPIN :**

    -   **students (and *sometimes* professor) helping students :** with the R stuff; the real stuff; the gobears stuff.

        ![](images/clipboard-3577138052.png)

    -   **students helping professor :** thinking about non-binary; non-categorical measures of gender (and race).

-   **Lab 2 is Posted.** We are going to work on this today. Yay.

-   **Brain Exam in Two Weeks.**

    -   We will practice next week. Gonna be chill.

    -   If can't attend section; attend another section. Or talk to GSI.

    -   **DSP :** you'll have extra time as needed. Can find quiet space as needed (just leave TECH in the classroom?)

-   **"I want more work!", said the student(s).**

    -   **ggplot2 :** for fancy graphs

    -   **Quarto / RMarkdown :** for more authentic ways of embedding code, output, and words together. (what I'm writing the textbook, class notes, and lab assignments in.)

# PART 1 : No Statistics In This Class

## A Picture Is Worth 1000 Words

### Florence Nightingale :

1.  Did you learn about Florence Nightingale in other classes?
2.  What did you remember learning about Florence Nightingale in other classes?

### Discussion.

Look at the graph below, and use it to answer the following questions.

1.  **Ice Breaker :** What's the worst time you've been sick? What's your best way of trying to feel better / self-care when sick?
2.  **Look at the graph below :** What’s going on in this graph / who cares / how can we use this knowledge??
    1.  there are three colors!!!
        1.  each color = a specific cause of death = A VARIABLE! = A CATEGORICAL [FACTOR]{.underline} VARIABLE = in the way this variable was measured, you could only die for one reasons.
            1.  LEVELS = the specific causes = wounds, disease, other
            2.  pattern : see more gray (death from disease)
        2.  months is also happening on this graph!! = A CATEGORICAL VARIABLE = you cannot be in multiple monthses; you must be in one month.
            1.  FACTOR = months
            2.  LEVEL = january, february, march, etc...
        3.  number of deaths = NUMERIC VARIABLE (COUNT DATA)
    2.  lots of dying \[war is awful\]
3.  **It's all linear models :** What are the variables in this graph? How would you organize these as a linear model?
    1.  death \~ [type of death]{.underline} + month + error

## Learning from Histograms (No Statistics Terms!)

Below are some data that I graphed[^1]. Take 1-2 minutes and SILENTLY (on your own) think about what you learn about the variable from this graph. Avoid FANCY STATS LANGUAGE - just explain the main ideas without those labels for now.

[^1]: You will work with these later in the semester once we review how to create a likert scale (that combines 10 questions into one variable).

```{r}
#| include: false
d <- read.csv("../datasets/Self-Esteem Dataset/data.csv", stringsAsFactors = T, na.strings = "0", sep = "\t")
head(d)
names(d)
summary(as.factor(d$Q4))
SELFES.df <- data.frame(d[,c(1:2,4,6,7)], 5-d[,c(3,5,8:10)])
summary(SELFES.df)
library(psych)
alpha(SELFES.df)
d$SELFES <- rowMeans(SELFES.df, na.rm = T)
```

```{r}
hist(d$SELFES, col = 'black', bor = 'white', 
     main = "Histogram of Self-Esteem", 
     xlab = "Self-Esteem Score", breaks = 15)
```

**Things We Learned From the Graph**

-   the graph is about self-esteem

-   the graph goes from a self-esteem of 1.0 to 4.0

-   RIVA : most self-esteem scores are about 2.5

-   MIA : as you go toward each end (1 or 4) there are less people with that specific self-esteem.

    -   more people have a self-esteem in the middle than either really high or really low –\> twice-ish as many people reported 4 vs. a 1.

-   graph is a little lumpier on the RIGHT side; more people tend to say they have a higher self-esteem than a lower self-esteem.

-   this is a LARGE dataset

**Things We Cannot Learn From the Graph**

-   RYAN : no idea the full range of the scale; or people's individual scores (people are grouped into categories); we don't know how self-esteem was measured.

-   other variables related to the demographics of these people : age, gender, occupation, height, weight, nation, education, etc.

-   REASONS FOR WHY GRAPH IS A LITTLE LUMPIER ON THE LEFT-SIDE THAN THE RIGHT SIDE????

    -   healthy to have a high self-esteem, and most people are healthy in 2025 CAPITALISM RULES NO PROBLEMS!!!

    -   social desirability to have higher self-esteem, so people tending to report that.

    -   the people who were surveyed had high self-esteem .

# PART 2 : Working in R

## CODE BOOK : The Covid-19 Behavior Dataset

-   **Look over the codebook (below).**

    -   What is one variable from the dataset that is interesting to you (if any)?

    -   Is this categorical or numeric data?

    -   What predictions do you have about this variable?

    -   How might you use this variable in a linear model (as a DV or as a IV?)

-   **Loading Data Issues :**

    -   **rename this to something short!**

    -   **posit.cloud :** clicking on the name to load (vs. the “Import Dataset”)

## IN R : The Covid-19 Behavior Dataset

Things we will do.

-   Open up Lab 2

-   Create an RScript

-   Load the Covid-19 Behavior Dataset (.csv file) and the CODE BOOK (.pdf)

    -   the CODEBOOK explains what the variables measured

    -   the .csv data file contains the data.

    -   Make sure the data loaded correctly into R

-   Graph some variables and learn about the individuals from this graph

    -   numeric data

    -   categorical data

-   Save your work for Lab 2, Questions 1 and 2 and 3. Yeah!

# BREAK TIME : MEET BACK AT 5:18 \[5 min\]

**WE BACK, AND MINI CLASS DATA IS LIVE :** [**tinyurl.com/miniclassexit**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvBoQcnSzw_vi5cS5GazYaAAuH0HPcDIi2uCnZuhVWBSTVfg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

MEANWHILE, SOME STUDENT QUESTIONS :

-   can u share your script?

-   how does your code wrap around (like NEO's sunglasses??)

# PART 3 : Defining Data

## Operationalization, Construct, and Measurement Error

-   **operationalization** : how researchers define the variable(s) they will study; this is a process; often the focus of a researcher’s question in the scientific method.
-   **construct** : some operationalized psychological phenomenon of interest. some examples below :
    -   voxel : three dimensional area of brain activation
    -   self-esteem : how a person feels about themselves
    -   secure attachment style : how much a person seeks out and trusts a relationship partner.
-   **measurement error :** when there is a lack of validity in our measures. The more error in our measures, the more error there will be in our predictions (“garbage in → garbage out”).

**KEY IDEA :** the way a variable is measured is CRITICAL.

-   **The News Article :** What comes to mind when you think of a "Cognitive Test"?

-   **The Scientific Operationalization of this "Cognitive Test"**

## ACTIVITY : Counting Interruptions

[**Check-in :**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4GahfYtKFiSEFL5blw0lAG6jZepRzmnAewfUI9_iUf3dv9w/viewform?usp=sf_link)[**tinyurl.com/dudesinterrupting**](http://tinyurl.com/dudesinterrupting)

1.  Count the number of interruptions in the video (which professor will play below). 

2.  Submit your answer, **then wait for the letter of the day.**

![](lecture_images/1_interruption_oreilly&frank_operationalization.m4v)

**DISCUSSION TOPICS :**

-   Why is this a problem for science???

    -   everyone has a different definition of the number of interruptions AND everyone all watched the SAME video.

    -   if we had a PERFECT measure of an interruption, then everyone's number would be the same.

-   How do we OPERATIONALIZE an INTERRUPTION?

    -   ONLY COUNT the number of times guy on the RIGHT is interrupted.

    -   ONE INTERRUPTION = the person on the RIGHT has to STOP their sentence and RESTART.

-   What PREDICTIONS can we make about counting interruptions a second time?

    -   there will be more similarity in our data the second time (LESS variation in t2 responses vs. t1)

    -   people will count fewer interruptions in T2 vs. T1

        -   we are only counting ONE person's interruption.

        -   the person had to RESTART their sentence.

# FOR NEXT WEEK
