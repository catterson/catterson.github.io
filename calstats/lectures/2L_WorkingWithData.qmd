## Agenda {.smaller}

-   **2:10 - 2:20.** Check-In & Review

-   **2:20 - 3:20.** Working with Data Using Computer Tool (R)

-   **3:30 - 3:40. BREAK TIME #1.** Long break.

-   **3:40 - 4:00.** Operationalization, Construct, and Measurement, Oh My!

-   **4:00 - 4:25.** Getting started on literature reviews.

-   **4:35 - 5:00.** Farewell & Questions About Grad School.

## Announcements {.smaller}

-   **DISCORD IS BUMPIN :**

    -   **students (*and sometimes professor*) helping students :** with the R stuff; the real stuff; the gobears stuff.

    -   **students helping professor :** "notes for next time" and clarifications for this time.

-   **Lab 2 is Posted.** We are going to work on this today. Yay.

-   **Brain Exam in Three Weeks (in section after the Chapter 4 lecture.)**

    -   We will practice in class and in section. Gonna be chill.

    -   If can't attend section; talk to your GSI (best : take in another one of their sections.)

    -   **DSP :** you'll have extra time (and quiet space) as needed. Went well last semester.

-   **"I want to learn more than is provided!", said the student(s).**

    -   **ggplot2 :** for fancy graphs.

    -   **Quarto / RMarkdown :** for more authentic ways of embedding code, output, and words together. (what I'm writing the textbook and class notes in.)

# PART 1 : Data With Human Brain and R

*A Picture Is Worth 1000 Words.*

## Florence Nightingale {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
1.  Did you learn about Florence Nightingale in other classes? \[Clap : Yes / No\]
2.  What did you remember learning about Florence Nightingale in other classes?

### Class Discussion. {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
1.  **Ice Breaker :** What's your favorite way to feel better when sick?
2.  What’s going on in this graph / who cares / how can we use this knowledge??
3.  What variables are in the graph? How would you organize them as a linear model?

## Lab 2

-   Paste Lab 2 questions into a Google Document you can edit.

-   Create a new R Script; save it as Lab 2.

-   **Access the [Onboarding Survey Data and Codebook](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/u8zr1swbl700sml2f1acp/AN0R4J7tyLqrIaUvDCAxDZs?rlkey=yhbjcobmlm8he9eu3i19mdiv7&dl=0)**

### THE CODEBOOK : Onboarding Survey {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   **Look over the codebook --\>**

    -   What is one variable from the dataset that is interesting to you (if any)?
    -   Is this categorical or numeric data?
    -   What predictions do you have about what this variable will look like?
    -   How might we use knowledge of this variable?

### DATASET : the Onboarding Survey {.smaller}

-   **Load the Data into R :**

    -   make sure you are working with stats_onboard.csv

    -   **posit.cloud :** clicking on the name to load (vs. the “Import Dataset”)

-   **The Three Things to Remember When Loading Data:**

    -   rename the long file name to something short!

    -   check the headers

    -   set stringAsFactor = TRUE

### Work on the Lab :

-   Graph two variables, make the graphs look nice, and learn about the individuals in the data from the graph.

    -   two numeric variables

    -   one categorical variable?

    -   no stats terms!

-   Save your work for Lab 2, Question 1. Yeah!

### Student Show and Tell? {.smaller}

the Chancellor Rich Lyons ~*is our Chancellor. Professor asked for a*~ Guest Lecture

# PART 2 : Defining Data

## Operationalization, Construct, and Measurement Error

-   **operationalization** : how researchers define the variable(s) they will study; this is a process; often the focus of a researcher’s question in the scientific method.
-   **construct** : some operationalized psychological phenomenon of interest. some examples below :
    -   **voxel :** three dimensional area of brain activation
    -   **self-esteem :** how a person feels about themselves
    -   **secure attachment style :** how much a person seeks out and trusts a relationship partner.
-   **measurement error :** when there is a lack of validity in our measures. The more error in our measures, the more error there will be in our predictions (“garbage in → garbage out”).

## **KEY IDEA :** the way a variable is measured is CRITICAL.

What comes to mind when you think of a "Cognitive Examination"?

## ACTIVITY : No talking please!

-   [**Check-in :**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4GahfYtKFiSEFL5blw0lAG6jZepRzmnAewfUI9_iUf3dv9w/viewform?usp=sf_link) [**tinyurl.com/dudesinterrupting**](http://tinyurl.com/dudesinterrupting)

-   Want to create consistent conditions for all to watch and hear. Thank you.

### Counting Interruptions

1.  Count the number of interruptions in the video (which professor will play below). 

2.  Submit your answer, **then wait for the letter of the day.**

![](lecture_images/1_interruption_oreilly&frank_operationalization.m4v){fig-align="center"}

### **DISCUSSION TOPICS :**

-   Why is this a problem for science???

-   How do we OPERATIONALIZE an INTERRUPTION?

-   What PREDICTIONS can we make about counting interruptions a second time?

# PART 3 : GETTING STARTED ON LITERATURE REVIEWS.

## Academic Business : Questions About These Terms? {.smaller}

**The People Involved:**

-   **author : the person(s) who writes the article**

-   **affiliations :** where the authors come from

-   **editor :** a person who sends the article to review, and ultimately decides whether to accept / reject an article for publication.

-   **peer reviewers :** other scientists who comment on the article and give feedback before it is published (unpaid, anonymous, and uncredited on the paper.

**Types of Scientific Articles**

-   **original report :** one or more studies where researchers collect original data to answer a specific question(s)

-   **replication :** a copy of a previous original report (with new people)

-   **literature review :** summarizes main ideas from past research to find common themes

-   **meta-analysis :** summarizes data from past studies to find common themes.

**The Ways To Evaluate :**

-   **citation count : the number of times that other people reference a specific article.**

-   **impact factor :** the average number of times the average article in a journal has been cited in an average year

-   **jargon :** the specific words psychologists use to define variables.

-   **APA Citation (or “Citation in APA Format”) :** a super specific way of referencing an article that you do NOT need to memorize because computers do this for us.

## Literature Review

-   [Link to Annotated Bibliography Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z6bwMrtC6glf2X2A55-cq0pI-smUV5LyLy9eyDiM5nA/edit?usp=sharing)

-   **Goals :**

    -   Learn more about the topic than you did before.

    -   See what past research has been done on your topic.

    -   Keep an organized record of what you find so you can access it later.
