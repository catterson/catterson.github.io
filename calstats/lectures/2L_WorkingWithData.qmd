### Check-In, Agenda, and Announcements

Welcome Back! Access this Document Here : https://catterson.github.io/calstats/calstatsSP25.html

[**PLEASE COMPLETE THIS CHECK-IN : tinyurl.com/againmodels**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRxOyLnGN7GO7ZQYziTuElo8k39b1feE915glmQMqI-1JBTA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

# PART 1 : No Statistics In This Class

## A Picture Is Worth 1000 Words

### Florence Nightingale :

1.  Did you learn about Florence Nightingale in other classes?
2.  What did you remember learning about Florence Nightingale in other classes?

|                                     |                                         |

### Discussion.

Look at the graph below, and use it to answer the following questions.

1.  **Ice Breaker :** What's the worst time you've been sick? What's your best way of trying to feel better / self-care when sick?
2.  **Look at the graph below :** What’s going on in this graph / who cares / how can we use this knowledge??
    1.  showing death from diseases, other causes, wounds.
    2.  time is split into twelve months (but also maybe there's something going on with season??)
    3.  hard to accurately represent deaths by triangles.
3.  **It's all linear models :** What are the variables in this graph? How would you organize these as a linear model?
    1.  mortality (among soldiers) \~ cause of death + time + ERROR

### KEY IDEA : Visuals Matter

-   What is better about the way the barchart[^1] visualizes these data?

-   What is worse (or still confusing)?

## Learning from Histograms (No Statistics Terms!)

Below are some data that I graphed[^2]. Take 1-2 minutes and SILENTLY (on your own) think about what you learn about the variable from this graph. Avoid FANCY STATS LANGUAGE - just explain the main ideas without those labels for now.

[^2]: You will work with these later in the semester once we review how to create a likert scale (that combines 10 questions into one variable).

```{r}
#| include: false
d <- read.csv("../datasets/Self-Esteem Dataset/data.csv", stringsAsFactors = T, na.strings = "0", sep = "\t")
head(d)
names(d)
summary(as.factor(d$Q4))
SELFES.df <- data.frame(d[,c(1:2,4,6,7)], 5-d[,c(3,5,8:10)])
summary(SELFES.df)
library(psych)
alpha(SELFES.df)
d$SELFES <- rowMeans(SELFES.df, na.rm = T)
```

```{r}
hist(d$SELFES, col = 'black', bor = 'white', 
     main = "Histogram of Self-Esteem", 
     xlab = "Self-Esteem Score", breaks = 15)
```

**Things We Learned From the Graph**

-   self-esteem scores are between 1 and 4.
-   more people have really high self-esteem than really low self-esteem
-   there's a lot of people in the data
-   the variable is self-esteem.
-   people have lots of different self-esteems
-   a lot of people are in the middle \[2.5???\]; it looks like a bell!
-   

**Things We Cannot Learn From the Graph**

-   "more people have really high self-esteem than really low self-esteem"
    -   self-esteem \~ age + error (and this dataset is maybe mostly older people?)
    -   "self-presentation" (people are presenting a desirable version of the self)
-   other variables that might be relevant to self-esteem!
    -   personality types
    -   attitudes
    -   self-perceptions of ego :P
-   who are all these people in this study???

## Creating a Mini Class Dataset

-   Here's a list of the variables that y'all thought would be interesting to measure in the class (and I approved) from the check-in.
    -   height \[numeric\]

        -   as categorical : group people in "buckets"

    -   \# of languages you speak (polyglots) \[numeric : discreet values

        -   fluency in language —\> more continuous

        -   are you multilingual : Y / N = categorical.

    -   r u an intended psych major

    -   where are you from?

    -   hat / no hat

        -   as categorical : Y / N

        -   as numeric : \# of hats

        -   as continuous : \# of seconds you've worn a hat on your head.

    -   age

    -   SPORT PLAYER

    -   birth month / date

    -   glasses or not

    -   alcohol consumption

    -   screen time

    -   happiness

        -   categorical : R U HAPPY Y/N

        -   scale : On a scale from 0 to 100....

    -   inner monologue or not

    -   self-consciousness / self-awareness
-   **DISCUSS :** which of these variables would be best measured with numbers (e.g., a scale from 0 to 10)? Which variables would best be measured with categories? (what would the factor and levels be?)
    -   Numeric Data Variables :
    -   Categorical Data :

# BREAK TIME : MEET BACK AT 3:23!!!!

# PART 2 : Working in R

## CODE BOOK : The Covid-19 Behavior Dataset

-   **Look over the codebook (below).**

    -   What is one variable from the dataset that is interesting to you (if any)?

    -   Is this categorical or numeric data?

    -   What predictions do you have about this variable?

    -   How might you use this variable in a linear model (as a DV or as a IV?)

-   **Loading Data Issues :**

    -   **rename this to something short!**

    -   **posit.cloud :** clicking on the name to load (vs. the “Import Dataset”)

## IN R : The Covid-19 Behavior Dataset

Things we will do.

-   Open up Lab 2

-   Create an RScript

-   Load the Covid-19 Behavior Dataset (.csv file) and the CODE BOOK (.pdf)

    -   the CODEBOOK explains what the variables measured

    -   the .csv data file contains the data.

    -   Make sure the data loaded correctly into R

-   Graph some variables and learn about the individuals from this graph

    -   numeric data

    -   categorical data

-   Save your work for Lab 2, Questions 1 and 2 and 3. Yeah!

# PART 3 : Defining Data

## Operationalization, Construct, and Measurement Error

-   **operationalization** : how researchers define the variable(s) they will study; this is a process; often the focus of a researcher’s question in the scientific method.
-   **construct** : some operationalized psychological phenomenon of interest. some examples below :
    -   voxel : three dimensional area of brain activation
    -   self-esteem : how a person feels about themselves
    -   secure attachment style : how much a person seeks out and trusts a relationship partner.
-   **measurement error :** when there is a lack of validity in our measures. The more error in our measures, the more error there will be in our predictions (“garbage in → garbage out”).

**KEY IDEA :** the way a variable is measured is CRITICAL.

-   **The News Article :** What comes to mind when you think of a "Cognitive Test"?

-   **The Scientific Operationalization of this "Cognitive Test"**

## ACTIVITY : Counting Interruptions

[**Check-in :**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4GahfYtKFiSEFL5blw0lAG6jZepRzmnAewfUI9_iUf3dv9w/viewform?usp=sf_link)[**tinyurl.com/dudesinterrupting**](http://tinyurl.com/dudesinterrupting)

1.  Count the number of interruptions in the video (which professor will play below). 

2.  Submit your answer, **then wait for the letter of the day.**

![](lecture_images/1_interruption_oreilly&frank_operationalization.m4v)

**DISCUSSION TOPICS :**

-   How do we OPERATIONALIZE an INTERRUPTION?

    -   when the guest on the right STOPS his sentence and has to restart.

    -   the number of times the guest on the right is INTERRUPTED by the host on the left.

-   What PREDICTIONS can we make about counting interruptions a second time?

    -   the number of interruptions at T2 will go down, since we narrowed it to a) stopping one person and b) just counting one person.

    -   the number of interruptions at T2 will be more similar to each other.
