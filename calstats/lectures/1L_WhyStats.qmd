# RECAP : Defining Research Questions

### Student Examples from Milestone #1

-   What's the variable at the focus of the following questions?
-   What does between vs. within-person variation look like?
-   Are you interested in the AFFECT, BEHAVIOR, or COGNITIVE part of this variable?

### Developing Research Questions from Real-Life

-   What are some real-life events that we want to better understand or change?
-   What are some research questions that we might develop based on real-life events?
-   How can we think about these questions using the ABCs of Psychology?
-   Is this a question about between-person or within-person variation?

# Part 1 : Defining Variables in R

### Numeric Variables in R

### ![](images/clipboard-812337385.png)

### In R : Creating Numeric Variables

Note : the code below might not run depending on your browser settings. professor will demonstrate this in class using R.

```{R}
#| echo: true
# defining the hours of sleep I got the last few nights.
prof.sleep <- c(5.5, 5, 7, 8.5, 6.5, 5, 7.0, 7.5, 7.5, 6, 6.5, 5) 
prof.sleep # this asks R to show the variable
hist(prof.sleep) # this asks R to graph the variable (a histogram)
```

### String Variables in R

![](images/clipboard-2893888681.png)

### Example in R : Creating Non-Numeric Variables {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
# defining the string variable; laundry I was drying.
laundryhang <- c("shirt", "shirt", "leggings", "shirt", 
                 "leggings", "shirt", "shirt", "sweater",
                 "leggings", "pants", "sweater", "sweater")
laundryhang # another way to "print" the variable

# changing the format of the sting variable into a categorical factor
laundryhang <- as.factor(laundryhang) 

# graph the non-numeric variable
plot(laundryhang) 
```

### **ACTIVTY :** Work on Lab 1, Question 1.

1.  **Open up the Weekly RScript.** Type some math into the Rscript, and send it to the console. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU ARE A PROGRAMMER. FRIEND OF COMPUTERS. CODE WIZARD.
2.  **Work on Lab 1, Question 1 :** Define two variables in R : one numeric, and one string. *Note : you can use the data that we collected in class, or collect your own data (make sure each variable has at least ten data points).* “Print” each variable in R, and paste the output as a screenshot. Then, graph the numeric variable as a “histogram” and the string variable as a “plot”. Below each graph, describe what you observe about the individuals in the dataset for each variable.

# From Variables to Predictions (and Beyond)

## Prediction & Power

### Predictions in Real Life

-   EXAMPLE : will it rain today?
    -   **Knowledge (what information did you use to make the prediction)?**
    -   **Power (ways your predictions influence future behaviors)**
    -   **Was The Predicton Valid?**
-   **Work on Lab Question.** What’s a prediction about people (or the world) that you made today? What information did you use to make this prediction? How did (or could) you use this prediction to influence outcomes? Were you valid in your predictions? Finally, write a linear model that defines the prediction (and information that you used) as a formula (e.g., DV \~ IV1 + IV2 + … + error).

### Scientific Predictions

Psychological scientists seek to better understand variation, in order to help make valid predictions in ways that help exert power over our environments.

[^1]: Here's [a link to the article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/facebook-bends-the-rules-of-audience-engagement-to-its-advantage.html) where this headline comes from. These data are a little dated, and I couldn't immediately find more recent data - my guess is Meta does not really want to advertise that people are using the product more and more. However, in [reports to investors](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Earnings-Presentation-Q2-2024.pdf) reports consistent growth in metrics like "ad impressions" and "daily active users". Let me know if you find other sources to show how technology companies are capturing more and more of our attention!

## The Linear Model

![](images/clipboard-606362939.png){fig-align="center" width="739"}

### RECAP : Definition and Examples

-   Steps to Take : 

    -   **list the variable that you want to predict (the DV)**

    -   **list the variables that you think will help predict the DV (the IVs)**

        -   **NOTE : you do not (and can not) account for EVERY variable in your linear model!**

        -   **IN FACT : researchers are very specific about the variables they will include.**

        -   **ERROR will capture all the other variables not in your model.**

-   Example : What predicts why people differ in the amount of screen time that they use (between or within-person differences)?

    -   

**KEY IDEA : Linear Models Help Organize and Quantify Prediction**

-   **organize :** a model specifies what information (IV) we think might help us predict the DV
-   **quantify :** when we add statistics to our model (much later!), we will see…
    -   **the direction of the prediction :** is there a positive or negative relationship between the IV and the DV?

    -   **the “weight” of the prediction :** how much does each IV help us predict the DV?

        -   what is the “best” predictor in our model?

        -   what is the “worst” predictor in our model?

    -   **the amount of error in our prediction :** how well does the model as a whole help us predict individual scores? how well does the model generalize to "reality"?

# So You Think You Want to Be a Researcher?

## Getting Research Experience as an RA

-   **RA = Research Assistant**

    -   Mostly Unpaid Experiences

    -   Some paid experiences exist!

        -   From the berkeley website…

        -   [Busine\$\$ \$chool](https://haas.berkeley.edu/mors/faculty/)

        -   Stanford \[maybe paid\]

        -   [A list a student sent me that they found](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IX7f1N_VXUkSnnJPTpLg-pUto0427XBK_jxRxNFhmps/edit?gid=1345132026#gid=1345132026).

        -   “Cold calling” labs who are doing work you think is cool.

        -   Chat with your TAs / Professors

-   **As an RA :**

    -   work with data : transcribing data; behavioral coding data; recruiting and participants to collect data; setting up psychophysiological recordings; cleaning data; etc.

    -   **other opportunities to gain skills you can demonstrate :**

        -   reading & discussing papers

        -   working with IRB (institutional review board - an ethics thing)

        -   analyzing data → presenting research at a conference (poster) or submitting a paper for publication \[your golden ticket\]

        -   general mentorship (how to apply to grad school; where to apply; who to talk to & e-mail; etc.)

        -   NOTE : this work and these skills apply to other work outside of research applications \[time management; coordinating schedules; juggling responsibilities; etc.\]

    -   **get a sense of whether this \[work or lab\] is for you?**

        -   do you enjoy the work? are you going to look forward to showing up and doing the work / fulfilling the commitment? 

        -   are you working with a horrible monster?

            -   not responsive

            -   inconsistent work / no plan for your work

            -   kind of a bully (emotionally abusive → stealing your work) 

        -   or are you working with someone who is super cool and a positive influence on mentoring young minds!?!?! \[YES!!!!\]

## Applying to Graduate School

-   **You are applying to work on research with a specific professor(s) at a school.**

    -   Should have a sense of the topic you want to pursue.

    -   Good to have a narrative about how your past work and studies have prepared you for this topic / demonstrate an enduring interest in the topic.

-   **Independent Thesis / Research Project :**

    -   **an official honors’ thesis**

    -   **undergraduate research project (e.g., SURF; Psych 101!)**

    -   **your own independent study / advanced work you did as an RA**

-   **Personal Statement : Experiences with Research You Can Write About**

    -   ~~I’m fascinated by people…Over the last year, I worked on an independent research study to better understand….~~

    -   Working as an RA; your research project; attending / presenting at a conference; etc.

-   **3-4 Letters of Recommendation :** folks who can speak personally to your ability to do research.

-   **Clinical Students : some kind of clinical internship / experience 😟**

-   **Talk to people who are doing the thing you want to be doing about their journey**
