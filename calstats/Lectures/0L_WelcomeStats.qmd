### Authentic Assessments

1.  **Brain Exams :** You look at some statistical results (graphs, tables) and interpret what you see with only your human brain to help you.
2.  **R Exam :** You are given a dataset and a research question and asked to prepare a report with access to every possible tool you could want to use (see course AI policy).
3.  **Final Project :** You learn more about a [psychological variable]{.underline} you care about, design a study to answer a question about this variable, collect the data from friends and family (n = 10), analyze the data using R, and write everything up as a research report.
    -   **Milestone #1 (in Section) :** What's a question you are interested in?

### AI Policy

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **AI as a tool** : you should be doing the learning.

-   **be transparent :** let us know how you used / share your prompts (see syllabus)

-   **imperfection is okay!** reach out for help if you are struggling.

# Part 2 : Why R?

## Visualization Activity

-   Close your eyes

-   Take a deep breath (inhale / exhale)

-   Visualize an image based on the word that you hear me say.

-   What do you observe?

## Why R?

-   **free :** open source, no cost,

-   **flexible :** can do many things (stats, graphs, authoring, works well with python tools)

-   **famous :** lots of tutorials, guides, courses, AI knows it, respected in psychology / sciences.

## R is Your New Friend

### **The R Console :**

-   where R does its work

-   what's your first reaction to this image? what does your eye look at? gloss over?

### **RStudio :** Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

![](images/clipboard-129412344.png){fig-align="center"}

## Activities.

-   Let's explore R (and when I say R, I mean to access & open RStudio.)

-   Things to do :

    -   create a script.

    -   write a basic math problem that caused you trouble as a kid.

    -   teach R something (use the assign function)

    -   play around! it's okay to break things.
