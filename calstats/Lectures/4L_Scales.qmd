### Professor Check-In Code

```{r}
#| include: false
## Q1. Load the mini_class dataset. 
mini <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/!WHY STATS/Class Datasets/cal_mini_SP25.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
## Call this mini to follow along with professor's code. 
## How many individuals are in this dataset?

## Q2. Graph the variable hrs.sleep, (hours of sleep students said they got.)
## What is the shape of this distribution?

## Q3. What is the average of hrs.sleep? 
## (Round to two decimal places for the check-in)

## Q4. What does this number mean / who cares about this value? [no R]

## Q5. What is the standard deviation of hrs.sleep?

## Q6. What does this number mean / who cares about this value? [no R]

## Q7. Professor's z-score for hours of sleep was -0.95. This means.... [no R]

## Q8. What is the standard deviation for the variable thirsty?
## This variable measured how tired students said they were
## on a scale from 0 (the least) to 10 (the most)


## Q9. Can professor say that there was more variation in how many hours
## of sleep people got than how thirsty they were?

## Q10. What is the average height in the class?
```

### Lab 3 Review : The Mode

```{r}

```

## Part 1 : The Z-Score (Scale Function)

### RECAP : What and Why Z-Score?

**The Z-Score**

-   distance from the mean

-   in units of standard deviation

**Why We Care :**

-   gives more context for how different an individual score is from other scores.

    -   example : work for Meta and get paid an above average salary in zuckbucks!!!

        -   how much above average???

        -   wtf is a difference of 10? Is that a lot or a little???

    -   example : your sleep last night (compared to others)?

        -   mean sleep = `{r} round(mean(mini$hrs.sleep, na.rm = T), 0)`

        -   sd sleep = `{r} round(sd(mini$hrs.sleep, na.rm = T), 1)`

-   removes the units from a variable :

    -   mean of a z-scored variable will always be zero

    -   st of a z-scored variable will always be 1

    -   all variables described in units of standard deviation In R : The Z-Score

### Z-Scoring in R

You can calculate the z-score manually, or you can use the `scale()` function.

```{r}
## Manual Z-Score : distance from the mean / sd
mini$hrs.sleepZM <- (mini$hrs.sleep - mean(mini$hrs.sleep, na.rm = T))/ sd(mini$hrs.sleep, na.rm = T)

## The scale() function
mini$hrs.sleepZ <- scale(mini$hrs.sleep) # the z-score transformation

## Comparing these calculations side-by-side
zcompare <- with(mini, data.frame(hrs.sleep, hrs.sleepZM, hrs.sleepZ)) # organizing our two variables
head(zcompare) # looking at the first few rows
```

It might be easier to look at this in graphical form. In the graph below,

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Click Here to Show the Code"

## A PICTURE IS WORTH 1000 WORDS : Raw Scores vs. Z-Scores
## REMEMBER : IT IS USUALLY BEST TO USE hist() FOR GRAPHING NUMERIC VARIABLES!
## I AM USING PLOT TO ILLUSTRATE THE MEAN, STANDARD DEVIATION, AND Z-SCORES.
par(mfrow = c(1,2)) # splits the graphics window
plot(mini$hrs.sleep, main = "Hours of Sleep [Raw Units]", ylab = "Hours of Sleep")
abline(h = mean(mini$hrs.sleep, na.rm = T), lwd = 5) # vertical line of mean
abline(h = mean(mini$hrs.sleep, na.rm = T) + sd(mini$hrs.sleep, na.rm = T), # vertical line of mean + sd
       lwd = 2, lty = 'dashed')
abline(h = mean(mini$hrs.sleep, na.rm = T) - sd(mini$hrs.sleep, na.rm = T), # vertical line of mean - sd
       lwd = 2, lty = 'dashed')

## Z-SCORED GRAPH. WAIT TO RUN!!!! :)
plot(mini$hrs.sleepZ, main = "Hours of Sleep [Z-Scores]", xlab = "Hours of Sleep")
abline(h = mean(mini$hrs.sleepZ, na.rm = T), lwd = 5) # vertical line of mean
abline(h = mean(mini$hrs.sleepZ, na.rm = T) + sd(mini$hrs.sleepZ, na.rm = T), # vertical line of mean + sd
       lwd = 2, lty = 'dashed')
abline(h = mean(mini$hrs.sleepZ, na.rm = T) - sd(mini$hrs.sleepZ, na.rm = T), # vertical line of mean - sd
       lwd = 2, lty = 'dashed')

## Part 2 : "Normal" Distributions and Likert Scales

### RECAP : The Normal Distribution

We think of psychological constructs as continuous variables :

```{r}
d <- array()
for(i in c(1:1000)){
  d[i] <- sum(replicate(10, sample(c(0,1), 1)))
  }
hist(d, main = "Theoretical Normal Distribution", xlab = "Self-Esteem", breaks = 10)
```

We Expect This To Occur When :

-   Multiple Explanations for Variation :

-   Those Multiple Explanations are Independent :

Below are Two Examples :

```{r}
plot(as.factor(mini$selfesteem))
```

### RECAP : A Likert Scale

#### Why Are We Doing This?

The Likert Scale is designed to help approximate a normal distribution, by asking multiple questions about the same variable (Multiple Explanations for Variation!)

Notice, that our single-item measures are not really continuous, but could be considered categories :

```{r}
plot(as.factor(mini$selfesteem), xlab = "Self-Esteem", main = "Categories of Self-Esteem")
```

#### **DISCUSSION : Evaluate the Satisfaction With Life Scale \[below\]**

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcZss3J31ASVtR12xe-FXqfQ0VDv7gD5xJy1VjLwMnQbllB2sSXTorc6z2yYE6ZxLOYJuNzM7Y6L1knT7mxtARK8Jh0tftUCloFunT5eh05mjOB-v6DCnWuGBBFQJfMhSQ3O0akkUPtuTd41xPkvU58tkDb?key=r8XgfFaZOalV_EMC4TmK4A){fig-align="center"}

-   **ICE-BREAKER :** Best / worst present you received?

-   **Describe features that you notice about this scale (try and use the terms we just learned!)**

    -   \# of items

    -   response scale :

        -   positively keyed items :

        -   negatively keyed items :

-   **Do you think this is a valid way to measure this construct?**

    -   REASONS NO :

    -   REASONS YES :

-   **How might you use this scale in a study (as an IV or a DV).**

### In R : Creating a Likert Scale

Let's create a variable about how GOOD people feel. What items from the mini dataset measure this (the high end and / or the low end)?

```{r}
names(mini)
```

#### STEP 1 : ORGANIZE AND EVALUATE THE ITEM RELIABILITY

```{r}
# install.packages('psych') # only need to do this once!
library(psych) # do this every time you restart R.

```

#### STEP 2 : CREATE AND INTERPRET THE SCALE

```{r}
# rowMeans()
```

## Part 3 : Project Workshop : You Need a Likert Scale!

### Step 1 : Identify a (Dependent) Variable in Your Model

-   Student Example Go Here

### Step 2 : Measure this in a Continuous Way

#### Method 1 : Find or Adapt an Existing Scale

-   **List of (Free) Scales :** <https://ipip.ori.org/newIndexofScaleLabels.htm>

-   **Google/Google Scholar :** add “construct” or “validation” or “scale” to your search

#### Method 2 : Write Your Own Scale

-   Keep items phrased in the same way. ("I am someone who....")

-   Keep items on the same response scale (1-5 or 1-7); usually higher numbers indicate more agreement with the question.

-   Make sure to include positive and negatively-keyed items.

### Examples for "Mega" Class Survey

-   **Love for Water Scale :**

    -   I think water is delicious.

    -   If I’m thirsty, it’s water I crave.

    -   I’d rather be thirsty than drink water.

    -   It’s a chore for me to drink water.
