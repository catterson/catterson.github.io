    ![](images/clipboard-2471091874.png)

-   **Specific Guidelines for Today's Lecture :**

    -   disagree with the point not the person.

    -   no name-calling or labels; instead of “you’re racist”...focus on the specific opinion / belief.

    -   root things in your experiences; realize that your experiences will bias you; seek to understand and listen from others.

    -   not your responsibility to change another person's mind; not going to happen today.

    -   keep it slow; let people finish their thought before starting a new one.

### **Overview of the IAT (Measure of Implicit Prejudice)**

::: column-margin
*Note : the IAT is not a perfect measure, and there’s a fair amount of debate about whether it is a reliable and valid measure as claimed (see here and here and here for academic examples of some of this debate). FWIW my hot take is that I believe a) implicit measures are really hard to quantify, b) the underlying mechanism that experiences shape our cognition is real, c) we live in a society that prioritizes white and male voices in various ways (history education; modern media; etc.), d) that A-C together would suggest it is very likely people would hold unconscious biases that reflect those in society, and E) it’s important to identify and name those biases if you want to address them. Happy to chat more; thx for attending my footnote talk. Anyway, [here’s a link to learn more or take a test for yourself](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html).*

    -   Do we need science? What are the arguments you've heard for why native american mascots are / are not racist?

        -   "IS RACIST"

            -   it appropriates the culture; inaccurate protrayals of a complex culture; perpetuates a defamation culture that doesn't really lead people to seek understanding / gain knowledge.

            -   important to recognize the brutal history of the US genocide against native americans, and historical views of native americans.

            -   dehumanizing : mascots are "less than" human; a caricature / cartoon / exaggeration / mockery (often used for comedy).

            -   cultural clothing has important significance within culture that is not recognized / ignored / mischaracterized.

            -   most members of the community are a) not involved in the creation or profits of the mascot and b) are actively against it \[*see Florida Seminoles for an alternative model.*\]

        -   "NOT RACIST"

            -   it celebrates the culture :

                -   hard to celebrate a culture if they are not consulted / approving.

                -   the "proud warrior" stereotype is actually rooted in racist and hateful dehumanization that was used to justify genocide.

            -   other groups have mascots, like the "Fighting Irish!" or "The Vikings!"

                -   Irish people were and currently are disciminated against (an interesting history of their "Whiteness")

                -   "Vikings" / Nordic people were not subject to the same violence that native groups were subject to / are valued / have sovereign country.

    -   Do science to test this question \[<https://osf.io/zbu3x/>\] 

-   **DISCUSS :**

    -   What has been your experience learning about indigenous culture? What indigenous authors, artists, or other forms of culture have you encountered?

        -   

    -   **How do you think implicit prejudice (IATscore) will be related to people’s attitudes toward the native american mascot? Why?**

        -   **POS** / NEG / NO RELATIONSHIP

    -   How do you think explicit prejudice (prejudiceNatAm) will be related to people’s attitudes toward the native american mascot? Why?

        -   **POS / NEG** / NO RELATIONSHIP

    -   Which variable (explicit or implicit prejudice) do you think will be a BETTER predictor of people’s attitudes about the native american mascot? Why?

        -   IMPLICIT BETTER / EXPLICIT BETTER / NO DIFF

            -   **implicit :** not everyone will be open to their thought and beliefs, but that will still influence them; harder to hide (than explicit); IAT emphasizes past, which might connect to how people perceive the mascot

            -   **explicit :** maybe people don't report, but the people who are explicit are gonna let that racism alllll hang out, and they will drive the relationship; easier to measure since it's conscious.

    -   Other Questions About

        -   how do you account for people lying on surveys?????

            -   modern racism a "safer" form of racism to measure.

## Working on [Lab 6.](../labs/Lab6.qmd)

See the link above for Lab 6. We will work on the lab together in class! Yeah!

### Problem 1.

These data measure Midwestern college students’ implicit and explicit prejudiced attitudes toward Native Americans, and their support for a college Native American mascot considered racist by local tribes. The researchers predicted that both implicit prejudice (IV1 = IATscore) and explicit prejudice (IV2 = prejudiceNatAm) would be related to more positive attitudes toward the native american mascot (DV = attitude). Test these researchers theory.

1.  Load the data, check to make sure the data loaded correctly, and graph each variable that will be used in your models.

```{r}
mascot <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/!WHY STATS/Chapter Datasets/mascot_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
head(mascot)
nrow(mascot)

hist(mascot$attitude)
hist(mascot$IATscore, main = "Higher Numbers = Associate NatAm with Old\nLower Number = Associate NatAm with Modern")
abline(v = mean(mascot$IATscore), lwd = 5)

hist(mascot$prejudiceNatAm)
```

1.  Define a linear model to predict the variable attitudes (DV) from implicit prejudice (IV1 = IATscore). Include a graph of the linear model, and report the slope and R2 value of this model beneath this graph.

```{r}
mod1 <- lm(attitude ~ IATscore, data = mascot)
plot(attitude ~ IATscore, data = mascot)
abline(mod1, lwd = 5)
```

```{r}
coef(mod1)
# INTERCEPT = THE PREDICTED VALUE OF Y WHEN ALL X VALUES ARE ZERO.

SSM <- sum(mod1$residuals^2)
SSM

SST <- sum((mascot$attitude - mean(mascot$attitude))^2)
SST
SST-SSM
(SST - SSM)/SST
```

-   BREAK TIME : MEET BACK AT 4:00

-   EVAN HAS QUESTIONS!!!

1.  Define a linear model to predict the variable attitudes (DV) from explicit prejudice (IV2 = prejudiceNatAm). Include a graph of the linear model, and report the slope and R2 value of this model beneath this graph.

```{r}
mod2 <- lm(attitude ~ prejudiceNatAm, data = mascot)
plot(attitude ~ prejudiceNatAm, data = mascot)
abline(mod2, lwd = 5)
mod2
```

```{r}
summary(mod2)$r.squared
```

1.  Describe what you observe about this relationship. Were the reserachers' theory supported? Why do you think these patterns exist? Which measure of prejudice (implicit or explicit) was a better predictor of the DV?
2.  PROFESSOR BONUS QUESTION LET'S GO!

```{r}
coef(mod1)
coef(mod2)
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(mascot$attitude, main = "SST = Mean as Prediction")
abline(h = mean(mascot$attitude), lwd = 5)
plot(attitude ~ IATscore, data = mascot, main = "SSM = IV1 as Prediction")
abline(mod1, lwd = 5)
plot(attitude ~ prejudiceNatAm, data = mascot, main = "SSM = IV2 as Prediction")
abline(mod2, lwd = 5)


```

Z-Scored!

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(scale(attitude) ~ scale(IATscore), data = mascot)
mod1Z <- lm(scale(attitude) ~ scale(IATscore), data = mascot)
abline(mod1Z, lwd = 5)
plot(scale(attitude) ~ scale(prejudiceNatAm), data = mascot)
mod2Z <- lm(scale(attitude) ~ scale(prejudiceNatAm), data = mascot)
abline(mod2Z, lwd = 5)
```

```{r}
round(coef(mod1Z), 2)
round(coef(mod2Z), 2)
```

### Problem 2.

How strong is the relationship between implicit and explicit prejudice? Define a linear model to test this prediction. Then, z-score your DV and IV in the linear model, and report (and interpret) the slope and $R^2$ value. How did these statistics change? How did they remain the same?

### Note : Work on Problem 3 (On Your Own) and Problem 4 (In Discussion Section!)

Make sure to include Problems 1 and 2 in your lab assignment, along with Problems 3 and 4. Thanks!

The RCA "Indian Head Test Pattern", as referenced in the text. ![](images/clipboard-2955135542.png)
:::

"In the dark times

Will there also be singing?

Yes, there will also be singing.

About the dark times?"

\- Bertolt Brecht

There was an Indian head, the head of an Indian, the drawing of the head of a headdressed, long haired, Indian depicted, drawn by an unknown artist in 1939, broadcast until the late 1970s to American TVs everywhere after all the shows ran out. It's called the Indian Head Test Pattern. If you left the TV on, you'd hear a tone at 440 hertz—the tone used to tune instruments—and you'd see that Indian, surrounded by circles that looked like sights through rifle scopes. There was what looked like a bullseye in the middle of the screen, with numbers like coordinates. The Indian head was just above the bullseye, like all you'd need to do was nod up in agreement to set the sights on the target. This was just a test. 

In 1621, colonists invited Massasoit, chief of the Wampanoags, to a feast after a recent land deal. Massasoit came with ninety of his men. That meal is why we still eat a meal together in November. Celebrate it as a nation. But that one wasn't a thanksgiving meal. It was a land deal meal. Two years later there was another, similar meal, meant to symbolize eternal friendship. Two hundred Indians dropped dead that night from supposed unknown poison.

By the time Massasoit's son Metacomet became chief, there were no Indian-Pilgrim meals being eaten together. Metacomet, also known as King Phillip, was forced to sign a peace treaty to give up all Indian guns. Three of his men were hanged. His brother Wamsutta was, let's say, very likely poisoned after being summoned and seized by the Plymouth court. All of which lead to the first official Indian war. The first war with Indians. King Phillip's War. Three years later the war was over and Metacomet was on the run. He was caught by Benjamin Church, Captain of the very first American Ranger force and an Indian by the name of John Alderman. Metacomet was beheaded and dismembered. Quartered. They tied his four body sections to nearby trees for the birds to pluck. John Alderman was given Metacomet's hand, which he kept in a jar of rum and for years took it around with him—charged people to see it. Metacomet's head was sold to the Plymouth Colony for thirty shillings—the going rate for an Indian head at the time. The head was spiked and carried through the streets of Plymouth before it was put on display at Plymouth Colony Fort for the next twenty five years. 

In 1637, anywhere from four to seven hundred Pequot were gathered for their annual green corn dance. Colonists surrounded the Pequot village, set it on fire, and shot any Pequot who tried to escape. The next day the Massachusetts Bay Colony had a feast in celebration, and the governor declared it a day of thanksgiving. Thanksgivings like these happened everywhere, whenever there were, what we have to call: successful massacres. At one such celebration in Manhattan, people were said to have celebrated by kicking the heads of Pequot people through the streets like soccer balls.

The first novel ever written by a Native person, and the first novel written in California, was written in 1854, by a Cherokee guy named John Rollin Ridge. His novel, The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta, was based on a supposed real-life Mexican bandit from California by the same name, who, in 1853, was killed by a group of Texas rangers. To prove they'd killed Murrieta and collect the five thousand dollar reward put on his head—they cut it off. Kept it in a jar of whiskey. They also took the hand of his fellow bandit Three Fingered Jack. The rangers took Joaquin's head and the hand on a tour throughout California, charged a dollar for the show. 

The Indian head in the jar, the Indian head on a pike were like flags flown, to be seen, cast broadly. Just like the Indian head test pattern was broadcast to sleeping Americans as we set sail from our living rooms, over the ocean blue green glowing airwaves, to the shores, the screens of the new world.

## Thinking More About $R^2$

### The Formula

$\Huge R^2 = \frac{SS_{total} - SS_{model}}{SS_{total}}$

::: panel-tabset
#### SST

SST refers to the sum of squared errors when using the mean to make predictions. This is called *total* because the mean is the starting place for our predictions; our predictions will never be worse than the mean, so we expect the error around the mean to be the largest it will ever be.

```{r}

#### SSM

SSM refers to the sum of squared residuals when using the linear model to make predictions.

## Milestone #2

-   Prof. looks over some examples of student surveys!

-   Other Notes From Student Questions Will Go Here.

## Milestone #4

Some Questions

-   do we need to use the template? \[**NO!!!!** don't worry about the template; the point of the template is to help you organize and summarize the past reseach you are reading; your TA will need to see that you've found and thought about SOME past resaerch.\]

-   i don't wanna outline an intro. \[just a draft...keep it simple\]

    -   example outline : sleep quality

        -   THE POINT : sleep quality is how people feel after they sleep, such as how restful people are.

        -   EVIDENCE / WHO CARES : sleep quality is importatn because it's related to productivity (CITATION), morale (CITATION), and social interaction (CITATION).

        -   THE POINT : screen time is related to sleep quality.

            -   EVIDENCE : In one study, researchers found Blah blah blah.

            -   WHO CARES : Screen use is increasing (CITATION), and important to know how that might be affecting sleep quality in ways that might interfere with well-being.

-   FOCUS ON :

    -   defining a linear model

    -   figuring out how to measure your variables.

### **Introduction Deconstruction :**

The introduction starts broad, but then quickly focuses on the variables in your model so readers can understand a) what your study is about and b) why you’re doing your study.

Only point out limitations with past research that you will address in your study; other limitations that you think future research will address should go in the discussion section. |

| **4. The Current Research**       | Explain what specific questions your study will address. Be clear by stating each idea as a hypothesis with language like, “I predict” or “My first hypothesis”.                                                                                                                                                                            |
