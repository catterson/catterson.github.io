## The Linear Model

### RECAP : The Mean as Prediction

Previously, we discussed how the mean could be used to make predictions of individuals.

$\huge y_i = \hat{Y} + \epsilon_i$

::: column-margin
$\Large y_i$ = the DV = the individual’s actual score we are trying to predict (remember $_i$ = index; a specific individual.)

-   **on the graph:** each individual dot (on the y-axis; the x-axis just describes when people submitted the survey.

$\Large \hat{Y}$ = our prediction (the mean).

-   **on the graph:** the solid red line

$\Large \epsilon$ = residual error = distance between the predicted values of y and the individual's actual value of y

-   **on the graph:** the distance between each dot and the line.
:::

```{r}
d <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/!WHY STATS/Class Datasets/old class datasets/101 - class data - SP25/cal_mini_SP25.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
plot(d$insta.follows, main = "Mean as a Model (Red Line)",
     xlab = "Index (Row in Dataset)",
     ylab = "# Of Accounts a Person Follows")
abline(h = mean(d$insta.follows, na.rm = T), lwd = 5, col = 'red')
```

We also talked about how we could quantify the total error in these predictions, by adding up the squared residual errors (the sum of squared errors).

```{r}
residual <- d$insta.follows - mean(d$insta.follows, na.rm = T)
SST <- sum(residual^2, na.rm = T)
SST
```

This number made no sense, but it is a critical statistic, since it quantifies how valid our predictions of individuals were when using the mean to make predictions. To give the statistics some context, we divided the sum of squared errors by the sample size (this is the variance) and then un-squared this number (by taking the square root). This new statistic - the standard deviation - served as an average of residual error that describes how far the average person differs from the mean.

```{r}
n <- length(na.omit(d$insta.follows)) # total number of individuals; omitting missing data.
sqrt(SST/(n-1)) # the equation for the standard deviation
sd(d$insta.follows, na.rm = T) # the function to get the same answer.
```

As scientists, our goal is to make accurate predictions of individuals. So we would want to find a way to make the sum of squared errors equal zero - have no error in our predictions. The mean is a good starting place, but it's one number. And people are complex.

**DISCUSS :**

-   **ICE BREAKER :** if you had to live inside one social media platform, what would it be and why???

-   **THINK ABOUT A LINEAR MODEL :** how do you think the variables (above) would help (or not help) us predict the number of accounts someone follows on instagram (insta.follows)? Why / why not???

### The Linear Model in FOUR EASY STEPS.

The model is a line that updates our predictions of one variable based on knowledge of another.

1.  Define your model : what is your DV? What are your IVs? How do you think they will be related???

    `# of accounts people follow on instagram ~ soc.mediause + error`

2.  Graph your DV and IV(s) : make sure the data look good.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(d$insta.follows)
max(scale(d$insta.follows), na.rm = T) # looking to see the max value and its z-score to determine whether its an outlier or not

hist(d$socialmed.use)
```

2.  Plot the relationship between the two variables.

```{r}
plot(insta.follows ~ socialmed.use, data = d)
mod <- lm(insta.follows ~ socialmed.use, data = d)
abline(mod, lwd = 5, col = 'red')
```

3.  Define the linear model and interpret the intercept and slope of the model.

```{r}
mod <- lm(insta.follows ~ socialmed.use, data = d) # defines the model; saves as mod
mod # shows me what is inside mod
plot(insta.follows ~ socialmed.use, data = d) # graphs the relationship 
abline(mod, lwd = 5, col = 'red') # draws a red line of width five based on mod
```

equation for a line : y = a + bX

```{r}
coef(mod)
# THE MODEL : insta.follows = 284 + 43.9 * X
## predicted value of insta.follows for someone with a social media usage of 5
284 + 43.9 * 5

```

::: column-margin
$\Large y_i$ = the DV = each individual’s actual score on the dependent variable.

-   **on the graph:** the value of each dot on the y-axis

$\Large a$ = the intercept = the starting place for our prediction. You can think of the intercept as "the predicted value of y when all x values are zero”.)

-   **on the graph:** the value of the line at X = 0

$\Large X_i$ = the IV = the individual's actual score on the independent variable (a different variable than the DV).

-   **on the graph:** the value of each dot on the x-axis

$\Large b_1$ = the slope = an adjustment we make in our prediction of y, based on the individual's x value.

-   **on the graph:** how much the line increases in y value when x-values increase by 1 unit.

$\Large \epsilon_i$ = residual error = the distance between our prediction and the individual's actual y value.

-   **on the graph:** the distance between each individual data point and the line.

## Activity : Define another model to predict insta.follows from another numeric IV!!!

```{r}
# Zara! 
hist(d$bored)
plot(insta.follows ~ bored, data = d)
mod2 <- lm(insta.follows ~ bored, data = d)
abline(mod2)

# Height!! (With the outliers)

mod3 <- lm(insta.follows ~ height, data = d)
plot(insta.follows ~ height, data = d)
abline(mod3, lwd = 5)

# Height!! (Without the outliers)
d$H2 <- d$height
d$H2[d$H2 < 40 | d$H2 > 100] <- NA # removing outliers!
hist(d$H2) 
mod4 <- lm(insta.follows ~ H2, data = d)
plot(insta.follows ~ H2, data = d)
abline(mod4, lwd = 5)

# INSTA.FOLLOWERS
d$insta.followers[d$insta.followers > 10000] <- NA # removing the outlier!
mod5 <- lm(insta.follows ~ insta.followers, data = d)
plot(insta.follows ~ insta.followers, data = d)
abline(mod5, lwd = 5)
```

## Evaluating Error

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(d$insta.follows, main = "Mean as a Model (Red Line)",
     xlab = "Index (Row in Dataset)",
     ylab = "# Of Accounts a Person Follows")
abline(h = mean(d$insta.follows, na.rm = T), lwd = 5, col = 'red')

plot(insta.follows ~ socialmed.use, data = d) # graphs the relationship 
abline(mod, lwd = 5, col = 'red') # draws a red line of width five based on mod
```

```{r}
SST # sum of squared errors when using the mean (we did this an hour ago)
mod$residuals # the residuals from my model
sum(mod$residuals) # add up to zero
SSM <- sum(mod$residuals^2) 
SSM # 37million errors.
SST - SSM # 1898280 LESS error when I use my model to make predictions.
(SST - SSM)/SST # about .05 or 5% reduction in the total error. 
```

\^\^\^ This is called $R^2$ \^\^\^

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(d$insta.follows, main = "Mean as a Model (Red Line)",
     xlab = "Index (Row in Dataset)",
     ylab = "# Of Accounts a Person Follows")
abline(h = mean(d$insta.follows, na.rm = T), lwd = 5, col = 'red')

plot(insta.follows ~ insta.followers, data = d) # graphs the relationship 
abline(mod5, lwd = 5, col = 'red') # draws a red line of width five based on mod

SSM5 <- sum(mod5$residuals^2)
SSM5
SST - SSM5
(SST - SSM5)/SST

```

## BREAK TIME : MEET BACK AT 3:52

## Final Project Workshop

### Milestone 1. Some Questions

-   do we need to use the template? \[**NO!!!!** don't worry about the template; the point of the template is to help you organize and summarize the past reseach you are reading; your TA will need to see that you've found and thought about SOME past resaerch.\]

-   i don't wanna outline an intro. \[just a draft...keep it simple\]

    -   example outline : sleep quality

        -   THE POINT : sleep quality is how people feel after they sleep, such as how restful people are.

        -   EVIDENCE / WHO CARES : sleep quality is importatn because it's related to productivity (CITATION), morale (CITATION), and social interaction (CITATION).

        -   THE POINT : screen time is related to sleep quality.

            -   EVIDENCE : In one study, researchers found Blah blah blah.

            -   WHO CARES : Screen use is increasing (CITATION), and important to know how that might be affecting sleep quality in ways that might interfere with well-being.

-   FOCUS ON :

    -   defining a linear model

    -   figuring out how to measure your variables.

### **Introduction Deconstruction :**

The introduction starts broad, but then quickly focuses on the variables in your model so readers can understand a) what your study is about and b) why you’re doing your study.
