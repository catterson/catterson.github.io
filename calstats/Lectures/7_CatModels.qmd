## [Check-In : A Quick Study](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJC8RLLtQf0Px0yz1nJjx-8CGXFrMcuUg_b3od54kHHPCEHQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

-   No talking, no looking up answers!
-   Will discuss next week :)

## Announcements & Reminders :

-   **It is almost Spring Break.** Class will end early today :)
-   **4/4 Lecture is ON ZOOM.** Will keep it short and engaging! Plan to participate / engage if you attend, or just watch the recording.
-   **Start Collecting Final Project Data?!** Your GSI hopefully has (or will) give you feedback on your final project; start collecting data. Make sure :
    -   Your DV is numeric.
    -   You measure each variable in your linear model as a separate variable.
    -   Each question has one response option (no "multiple multiple choice" or "checkbox".)
    -   Other issues?

## $R^2$ In Real-Life

-   **DISCUSS :** **what do these linear models tell us about the relationship between GPA, SAT (IVs) and freshman grades (DV)?**

## When the IV is Categorical...

### We Load the Data

```{r}
d <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/!WHY STATS/Class Datasets/cal_mini_SP25.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
```

### We Graph our Variables.

```{r}
hist(d$satlife)
plot(d$stoned72) # an empty level!
levels(d$stoned72)[1] <- NA
plot(d$stoned72) # an empty level is GONE.
```

### We Define and Graph Our Linear Model.

The Model Coefficients : An Intercept and Slope

```{r}
mod <- lm(satlife ~ stoned72, data = d)
coef(mod)
```

The Graph Will Help Our Interpretation.

```{r}
library(gplots)
plotmeans(satlife ~ stoned72, data = d)
coef(mod)
summary(mod)$r.squared
```

-   The IV has been DUMMY CODED.
    -   when stoned72 = 0 = "No" (Or not "Yes")
    -   when stoned72 = 1 = "Yes"
-   The Intercept is : The Predicted Value of Y when all X-Values are Zero.
-   The Slope is : How our Predicted Value of Y changes when X changes by one.

### We Interpret Our Linear Model.

-   What is the relationship?
-   How strong is this relationship?
-   Why do we find this relationship in the data?
    -   CAUSALITY : smoking marijuana causes people to feel more satisfied with their lives.
        -   marijuana cuts off oxygen to brain; makes them delirious?
        -   it is an effective stress management strategy
        -   dopamine spikes highest when anticipating; the question triggered the response and life is good TM
        -   you are numbing yourself to the horrors in the world, escaping into a void of short-term pleasure and a delusion that things will be okay omg is everyone looking at me right now okay I'm gonna stop next time...I promise...
        -   satlife is a temporary state.
        -   maybe some recency bias; people who were stoned only thinking about short-term positive feelings; not contextualizng the pain; the horror.
        -   drugs make you feel good!!!!
        -   not smoking / doing drugs might cause you to be lower in satisfaction with life because you are attending to things?
    -   REVERSE CAUSATION : satisfaction with life might cause people to smoke weed?
        -   people who are feelin great feel like they can sit back; blaze one up; just relaaaaaxxxxxx.
        -   people who are HECKA STRESSED might not want to invite marijuana into their lives.
    -   CONFOUND / THIRD VARIABLE :
        -   a chill personality (someone low in Negative Emotion) may a) be more likely to use marijuana and b) more likely to be satisfied w/ their life.
        -   money : someone with a lot of \$\$ might be more satisfied with their lives, and more likley to buy weed (which does have a cost).
        -   free time / sleep / stress.
    -   CHANCE : we found this pattern due to chance.
-   Who cares about this relationship?
-   What other questions do we have about these data?

### YOUR TURN : Define another linear model to predict a numeric DV from a categorical IV (with 2 levels.)
