## [Check-In : Testing Theories](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQNQq1O8s_f0tx3l2FxIJo9Rt6zgmZA40T2AqLFdwjFtFtpA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

**Work with a buddy, or go lone wolf, to test the following theories using the "cal_mini" dataset. Name the dataset d to follow along with the professor.**

1.  There is a relationship between how tired people are (DV = tired) and how bored people are (IV = bored).
2.  There is a relationship between how tired people are (DV = tired) and how many hours of sleep people got (IV = hrs.sleep).

**You and your buddy should each define and interpret ONE of the linear models above. Use the models to answer the questions below for the check-in?**

1.  What is the relationship between bored and tired (in "raw" / "unstandardized" units)?
2.  Is this result statistically significant? Why / why not?
3.  What is the relationship between hrs.sleep and tired (in "raw" / "unstandardized" units)?
4.  Is this result statistically significant? Why / why not?
5.  Which variable - bored or hrs.sleep - is a BETTER predictor of tired? Why / how do you know?

**Professor Code**
```{r}
d <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/!WHY STATS/Class Datasets/cal_mini_SP25.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
head(d)
nrow(d)

## describing variables
hist(d$bored)
hist(d$tired)
hist(d$hrs.sleep)

## linear model 1 : predicting tired from bored.
mod <- lm(tired ~ bored,data=d)
plot(jitter(tired) ~ jitter(bored),data=d)
abline(mod, lwd = 5)
plot(mod) # NOT YET!!!
coef(mod) # intercept = 6.1351767   slope = 0.1568112 
## linear model 2 : predicting tired from hrs.sleep.

```
```{r}
summary(mod)
```
```{r}
mod2 <- lm(tired ~ hrs.sleep, data = d)
plot(tired ~ hrs.sleep, data = d)
abline(mod2, lwd = 5)
```

```{r}
summary(mod2)
0.04748^.5 # the square root of R2 = r = the correlation coefficient.
```

## REVIEW : Multiple Regression (Hair Length Predicts Height?!?!?????)

### Data Cleaning and Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
## Data Cleaning
library(gplots)
d <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/!WHY STATS/Class Datasets/cal_mini_SP25.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)

d$height[d$height < 10 | d$height > 100] <- NA
levels(d$is.female)[1] <- NA
levels(d$long.hair)[1] <- NA

par(mfrow = c(1,3))
hist(d$height)
plot(d$is.female, xlab = "Is Female?")
plot(d$long.hair, xlab = "Has Long Hair?")
```

### Activity and Discussion : Comparing Models

1.  **ICE-BREAKER :**

    1.  *let's keep it light mode :* if you HAD to get a tattoo, what would you get? where would you get it? would it face toward you or other people?

    2.  *bring on the heavy mode :* if you could change one thing about your childhood, what would you change?

2.  **MODEL INTERPRETATION :** What Do You Observe in Model 1? Model 2?

3.  **MODEL 3 :** What Do You Observe Changing About the Slopes from the Bivariate Model (Models 1 and Model 2) to the Multivariate Model (Model 3)?

4.  **Other Questions That You, the Students, Have?**

::: panel-tabset
#### Height \~ long.hair

```{r}
plot(d$long.hair)
moda <- lm(height ~ long.hair, data = d)
summary(moda)
plotmeans(height ~ long.hair, data = d, connect = F)
```

#### Height \~ is.female

```{r}
modb <- lm(height ~ is.female, data = d)
summary(modb)
plotmeans(height ~ is.female, data = d, connect = F)
```

#### height \~ long.hair + is.female

```{r}
modc <- lm(height ~ long.hair + is.female, data = d)
summary(modc)
```
:::

### IV1 and IV2 are related to each other, and each related to the DV)

```{r}
plot(d$long.hair ~ d$is.female)
```

### Multiple Regression : Visualized in Multi-Dimensional Space!

The code below may not work on your computer; see lecture recording for an interpretation / explanation!

``` r

#install.packages('rgl')
#install.packages('car')
library(car)
library(rgl)

scatter3d(as.numeric(d$is.female), # IV1 - must be numeric (if not already)
          d$height, # DV
          as.numeric(d$long.hair)) # IV2 - must be numeric (if not already)
```

### Reporting Effects in a Regression Table.

**Table 1.** Unstandardized Regression Coefficients; Predicting Height from Long.Hair and Is.Female.

|                             | Model 1 | Model 2 | Model 3 |
|-----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Intercept                   |         |         |         |
| Long.Hair (0 = No; 1 = Yes) |         |         |         |
| Is.Female (0 = No; 1 = Yes) |         |         |         |
| $R^2$                       |         |         |         |

**There's a Package in R For This!**

```{r}
# install.packages("jtools") # a new package!!!
library(jtools) # make sure you installed the new package first.
export_summs(moda, modb, modc,
             coefs = c("Long Hair (0 = No, 1 = Yes)" = "long.hairYes",
                       "Is Female (0 = No, 1 = Yes)" = "is.femaleYes"))
```



## Multiple Regression Tables

-   **ICE BREAKER :** If you could learn one skill all at once (like Neo in the Matrix; have y'all seen that movie???), what would it be??

-   **Evaluate the table above and think about multiple regression.**

    -   how would you write out Model 1, Model 2, Model 3, etc.

        -   Model 1 :

    -   what do we learn from this table / what changes in slope seem important (and why)? 

    -   what are some other real-life (and psychological) examples of situations where a 3rd variable might be important to study??

    -   what is the multivariate regression you will include in your final project? why might this be interesting to test?

## Milestone #4 : Anyone want to share their example?

-   Student Work Go Here.

## Other Exam Questions / Practice

### Miscelaneous Student Questions Go Here

```{r}
names(d)
library(gplots)
plot(d$tuhoburat)
levels(d$tuhoburat)[1] <- NA
mod1 <- lm(hrs.sleep ~ tuhoburat, data = d)
plotmeans(hrs.sleep ~ tuhoburat, data = d, connect = F)

```
## MORE MULTIPLE REGRESSION
```{r}
library(jtools)
mod1 <- lm(tired ~ bored,data=d)
mod2 <- lm(tired ~ hrs.sleep,data=d)
mod3 <- lm(tired ~ bored + hrs.sleep,data=d)
export_summs(mod1, mod2, mod3)
summary(mod1)
```
## ANOHTER EXAMPLE HAHAAHA. A BUST! IGNORE!!!
```{r}
names(d)
m1 <- lm(rlove ~ engaging, data = d)
m2 <- lm(rlove ~ bored, data = d)
m3 <- lm(rlove ~ bored + engaging, data = d)

export_summs(m1, m2, m3)

```


### Some Pre-Recorded NHST Review Videos

-   **Note : I used last semester's dataset for these examples, so you will likely get different results if you try and replicate in this semester's class; a good example of how NHST doesn't really tell us whether the results are "truth" or not, or whether they will replicate, etc.**
