# Part 1 : Discussing Objectivity Interrogations {.smaller}

## What was reading this article like?

-   Quick scan vs. long read?
-   Confusing ideas or sentences, clarified?

## Defining and Debating Objectivity

**Clap for No / Yes / Unsure**

-   Do you think it's possible for psychologists to be objective?
-   Do you think psychologists should try to be objective?
-   Do you think objectivity should require a lack of personal identity or agenda?

## Interrogations in Research or Real-Life

**When Peer-Reviewers are "Just Asking Questions"**

# Part 2 : Good Measures {.smaller}

## RECAP : Reliability and Validity

::: r-fit-text
| Term | Step Counter Example |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **face validity:** does our measure or result look like what it should look like? |  |
| **convergent validity:** is our measure similar to related concepts? (does one measure give the same information as another similar measure?) |  |
| **discriminant validity:** is our measure different from unrelated concepts? (Does one measure give different information as another different measure?) |  |
| **test-retest reliability:** do we get the same result if we take multiple measures? |  |
| **inter-rater reliability:** would another observer (or test or machine) make the same measurements? |  |

## EXAMPLE : An Issue of Reliability or Validity?

## ACTIVITY : Applying Terms of Reliability and Validity {.smaller}

-   **In the [RESEARCH METHODS VISION BOARD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14u3w5edvo6KSFRw2U9t1knDANFSGBWOvDjS7-ZGujos/edit?usp=sharing)...**

    -   Apply the terms of reliability and validity to the measurement device.
    -   Work with a buddy. No step walkers since we did this already.

# We Should Probably Say Goodbye At This Point.

# Part 3 : Operationalization

## DEFINITION : Operationalization

-   Say this word outloud.

-   What comes to mind when you see this word?

### A "Cognitive Examination" in Popular Press

### "Cognitive Examination" Operationalized{.smaller}

![](images/2L_MOCA.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

## ACTIVITY : No talking please!

**CHECK-IN AGAIN : [tinyurl.com/researchinterruptions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDt9g2s4rELaKorXyprVgtOa0Smb8ooI_FIWNg2i7iXKpazA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

-   Count the number of interruptions in the video (which professor will play soon). 

-   Submit your answer, **then wait for the letter of the day.**

![](images/1_interruption_oreilly&frank_operationalization.m4v){fig-align="center"}

### **DISCUSSION TOPICS :**

-   Why is this a problem for science???

-   How do we OPERATIONALIZE an INTERRUPTION?

-   What PREDICTIONS can we make about counting interruptions a second time?

## BYE.
