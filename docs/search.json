(WS) and https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/ (LSR) for students looking for more support.\n\n\n\nYour grade in the class will be based on the following components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10% Attendance\n30% R Exams [10 + 20]\n10% Article Presentations\n\n\n20% Lab Assignments\n20% Final Project\n10% Article Discussions\n\n\n\nLetter grades will be based on the following : A+ is &gt; 96.5; A is &gt; 92.5; A- is &gt; 89.5; etc. Note that an 89.49999 is a B+.)\n\n\n\n\nAttendance (Lecture and Discussion Section): Because we all learn from each other; attendance is required. You may miss up to two lectures and two discussion sections with no penalty.\nArticle Discussion. Each week, students will be responsible for leading class discussion of one article. All students should plan to read the article, and post comments to a discussion forum on bCourses. See the [Student Presentation | Description and Rubric] for a list of articles, a link to sign up, and a description of what is required for these student-led presentations. Let me know if you have other ideas for ways to engage the class in discussion about an article (or another article you think you would be good for the class to read.)\nLab Assignments : Most weeks, you will work through a ‚Äúlab‚Äù assignment that is designed to help practice the skills we review in lecture and readings. You can expect to work on these in lecture, in your discussion section, and at home as needed. Each lab document will have a set of questions to answer - you should submit answers to these questions as a separate document to bCourses. Lab assignments are due the week after they are assigned; late lab assignments will not be accepted. You can drop your lowest submitted lab assignment.\nFinal Project (Research Paper) : You‚Äôll apply the skills you have learned this semester to analyze, interpret, and share results from a research question relevant to your research interests. There will be several milestones to support this assignment. See the [Final Project | Description and Rubric] for more information.\nR Exam : For each exam, I‚Äôll give you a novel dataset and you‚Äôll use R to answer questions based on the dataset. The exam will be open-book and open note - you must work alone, but may use any resource available to you (including the Internet). A practice exam will be posted at least one week before the exam. The mini exam should take no more than 50 minutes to complete (we will have class afterward), and you will have the full 3-hours to complete the mega exam.\nExtra Credit : There will be no extra credit offered in this course, even for students who ask kindly.¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer Access. Access to a personal computer is strongly recommended. We will spend time each lecture working in R - a free and powerful statistics program that works with all operating systems and computers. Laptops are available for rent from the library (see Berkeley‚Äôs Technology Loan Program), or you can purchase one that will work for this class for as little as $150 (less than the price of most textbooks, which is not required for this class).\nLate Work Policy. Late assignments will not be accepted. You may drop your lowest scoring lab assignment. Let me know if you cannot attend the exam and we can schedule a make-up exam.\nDiscussion Section Policy : In-person attendance is expected and required for discussion sections. Students may miss up to two discussion sections with no penalty. Please talk to your GSI / the professor if there is a longer-term illness or issue that will prevent you from regularly attending your discussion section and we will work out another arrangement.\nRegrades. Students may ask for a re-grade on exams and papers if they believe they lost points for something they should have earned. To request a regrade, talk to your GSI in office hours or set up a meeting. In the case that you and your GSI cannot resolve the regrade issue, the professor will step in and regrade the exam. For final project regrades just e-mail the professor. When requesting a regrade, you consent to have your score increased or decreased if we find that you earned points you should not have earned.\nStudent Contact. It is your responsibility to regularly check e-mail for announcements. If you have specific questions to e-mail me, please make sure to (a) search the syllabus and / or Google for the answer to your question and (b) contact your GSI about your question. I am always happy to answer any questions in office hours (either during the scheduled time or online by appointment), or before, during, or after lecture. I should respond to e-mail within 24 hours on weekdays (I do not check e-mail on weekends); please send a gentle reminder if I do not respond in this timeframe. Thanks!\nAcademic Integrity. Do NOT cheat. Do NOT plagiarize. To copy text or ideas from another source (including your own submitted coursework) without appropriate reference is plagiarism. You may work on lab assignments with other students, but should be able to understand what you are doing. You may not work with other students on the R exam. Anyone caught cheating or plagiarizing will receive a zero on the assignment or test, and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. It is your responsibility to read the official Student Conduct Policy for more information about campus standards and policies regarding Academic Integrity.\nChat-GPT / AI Policy. If you use ChatGPT or other generative-AI software for any part of this class (writing, coding, troubleshooting, etc.), you must make this clear at the top of your assignment by writing : ‚ÄúI USED CHAT GPT TO SUPPORT THIS ASSIGNMENT‚Äù (in all-caps and red text), and include an appendix where you include screenshots of your specific queries and answers. Failure to do this will result in a zero of the assignment, and the professor submitting a report to the Academic Integrity Office. Ask your GSI / professor if you have questions about this policy.\nRespect for Others. We all belong in our classroom, and I hope that everyone feels free and supported to express our identities when relevant. To achieve this goal, make sure that you are treating others with respect in this course. This means considering others‚Äô opinions and perspectives, making sure not to generalize to groups (or ask students to be representatives of their group), and being mindful of the words that you use. (Also remember that nothing is ever really deleted from the internet, so please be extra mindful of the words you use.) While I will be monitoring class posts and communication, feel free to reach out to me if you see another student engaging in disrespectful or threatening behavior. Of course, this extends to me as well - if you feel like there are parts of the course instruction, subject matter, or class environment that create barriers to your success or inclusion, please contact me via e-mail and trust that your voice will be heard and I will not punish you for offering constructive criticisms of my teaching. I‚Äôm very open to learning how to be a better teacher, and always learn a lot from my students.\nSensitive Subjects. Our class will touch on important and potentially sensitive topics that are related to psychology and psychological processes, such as racism, depression, sex, and poverty. These topics can generate strong emotional responses in students for a variety of reasons - such as their own past histories with these topics or their reactions to the ways the information is presented or described. I will try to make sure to give you a heads up when we start to discuss these topics so you can be mindful of your reactions.\nStrategies for success. Do your readings, complete assignments on time, understand how the topics and information relate to what you‚Äôve learned (and are learning), and if you don‚Äôt understand something, please ask the question!\nMost important. Please let me know as soon as there is anything going on in your life that you think may affect your ability to do as well as you would like in this class (e.g.¬†sickness, work, small children at home, threats to immigration status, etc.), and I will do my best to work with you on a plan to succeed in the class. If you‚Äôre not comfortable talking to me directly, you can talk to your GSI who can talk to me about your issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with Disabilities : Students who require support or adaptive equipment because of a specific disability ‚Äì or would like to be tested to see if they qualify for a learning, auditory, or visual disability ‚Äì can request these services through the Disabled Students Program (DSP) office. Please note that I can only provide accommodations authorized by the DSP office. If you have DSP status, make sure you submit your letter and feel free to talk to me or a GSI about any specific accommodations you need, or other ways we might be able to make the class more accessible. [260 C√©sar E. Ch√°vez Student Center| 510-642-0518 | https://dsp.berkeley.edu/]\nStudents with Mental Health Issues : If you feel a mental health issue (e.g., depression, anxiety) is negatively impacting your ability to succeed, I‚Äôd highly encourage you to seek out experts who can help. Berkeley has several free, confidential, and science-based programs designed to help students. [https://uhs.berkeley.edu/caps | Tang Center 3rd Floor | 510-642-9494 | After hours support line : 855-817-5667]\nUndocumented Students : I believe that all people deserve equal access to education. The UC Berkeley Undocumented Student Program has organized resources to support undocumented students, protect their rights, and offer potential financial aid | https://undocu.berkeley.edu/\nStudents from Low-Income Backgrounds : The Extended Opportunity Program (EOP) provides college support services for low-income students. Services include additional counseling, financial assistance (study-time parent grants, work-study assignments, and book vouchers), child-care opportunities, and assistance transferring to four-year colleges.

(Let me know if you have ideas for other articles to read in this / future semesters!)\n\nAll students will submit discussion responses by Wednesday at noon; these discussion posts should demonstrate you have done the reading, and highlight a question or discussion topic you think would be good to focus on more in class.\nA small group of students will be responsible for organizing a 15-20 minute presentation and discussion on the assigned article, based on the reading and submitted student discussion posts.\n\nThis presentation will be graded on the following criteria. Though I‚Äôm very open to ideas and suggestions about alternative ways you think we could effectively use this time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nPoints [Out of 4]\n\n\nStudents gave a quick (5 min) summary of the key points from the assigned article.\n\n\n\nStudents drew from submitted discussion posts to lead a class discussion that helped answer common questions, debate ideas, and connect readings to our work as researchers.\n\n\n\nStudents organized a presentation and / or handout to help guide audience understanding.\n\n\n\nStudent presentation demonstrated preparation, organization, thought, and coordination among group members.\n\n\n\nStudents completed the self- and peer-evaluation form."

Load one dataset posted to our ‚ÄúDatasets‚Äù folder; make sure to give the dataset a name; check the headers, and set stringsAsFactors = T. Note that some datasets are saved as .xlsx files, and will need to be loaded using a package - feel free to skip these for now if this feels confusing. For each dataset, use R to report the following statistics. Add comments to your code that describe what you learn from the output.\n\nthe number of individuals (rows) in the dataset.\nthe number of variables (columns) in the dataset.\nthe names of the variables in the dataset.\nthe value of the 5th row, 2nd column in the dataset.\nprint two variables from the dataset - what do you learn from just looking at these data? No need for summary statistics yet :)\nWhat is a question you might ask about a variable from this dataset? Why might this question matter?\n\nRead the article ‚ÄúData Organization in Spreadsheets‚Äù. Choose one of the datasets uploaded to the Datasets folder on bCourses, and look over the dataset (and corresponding Codebook). What are some ways that this dataset adhered to these ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù? What are some ways that the dataset did not? What is something from this article that you learned? What did you have a question about?\nChallenge Problem1. Quarto (and Markdown) can also be used to make a website.

    "text": "Attendance (Lecture and Discussion Section): Because we all learn from each other; attendance is required. You may miss up to two lectures and two discussion sections with no penalty.\nArticle Discussion. Each week, students will be responsible for leading class discussion of one article. All students should plan to read the article, and post comments to a discussion forum on bCourses. See the [Student Presentation | Description and Rubric] for a list of articles, a link to sign up, and a description of what is required for these student-led presentations. Let me know if you have other ideas for ways to engage the class in discussion about an article (or another article you think you would be good for the class to read.)\nLab Assignments : Most weeks, you will work through a ‚Äúlab‚Äù assignment that is designed to help practice the skills we review in lecture and readings. You can expect to work on these in lecture, in your discussion section, and at home as needed. Each lab document will have a set of questions to answer - you should submit answers to these questions as a separate document to bCourses. Lab assignments are due the week after they are assigned; late lab assignments will not be accepted. You can drop your lowest submitted lab assignment.\nFinal Project (Research Paper) : You‚Äôll apply the skills you have learned this semester to analyze, interpret, and share results from a research question relevant to your research interests. There will be several milestones to support this assignment. See the [Final Project | Description and Rubric] for more information.\nR Exam : For each exam, I‚Äôll give you a novel dataset and you‚Äôll use R to answer questions based on the dataset. The exam will be open-book and open note - you must work alone, but may use any resource available to you (including the Internet). A practice exam will be posted at least one week before the exam. The mini exam should take no more than 50 minutes to complete (we will have class afterward), and you will have the full 3-hours to complete the mega exam.\nExtra Credit : There will be no extra credit offered in this course, even for students who ask kindly."

    "text": "Computer Access. Access to a personal computer is strongly recommended. We will spend time each lecture working in R - a free and powerful statistics program that works with all operating systems and computers. Laptops are available for rent from the library (see Berkeley‚Äôs Technology Loan Program), or you can purchase one that will work for this class for as little as $150 (less than the price of most textbooks, which is not required for this class).\nLate Work Policy. Late assignments will not be accepted. You may drop your lowest scoring lab assignment. Let me know if you cannot attend the exam and we can schedule a make-up exam.\nDiscussion Section Policy : In-person attendance is expected and required for discussion sections. Students may miss up to two discussion sections with no penalty. Please talk to your GSI / the professor if there is a longer-term illness or issue that will prevent you from regularly attending your discussion section and we will work out another arrangement.\nRegrades. Students may ask for a re-grade on exams and papers if they believe they lost points for something they should have earned. To request a regrade, talk to your GSI in office hours or set up a meeting. In the case that you and your GSI cannot resolve the regrade issue, the professor will step in and regrade the exam. For final project regrades just e-mail the professor. When requesting a regrade, you consent to have your score increased or decreased if we find that you earned points you should not have earned.\nStudent Contact. It is your responsibility to regularly check e-mail for announcements. If you have specific questions to e-mail me, please make sure to (a) search the syllabus and / or Google for the answer to your question and (b) contact your GSI about your question. I am always happy to answer any questions in office hours (either during the scheduled time or online by appointment), or before, during, or after lecture. I should respond to e-mail within 24 hours on weekdays (I do not check e-mail on weekends); please send a gentle reminder if I do not respond in this timeframe. Thanks!\nAcademic Integrity. Do NOT cheat. Do NOT plagiarize. To copy text or ideas from another source (including your own submitted coursework) without appropriate reference is plagiarism. You may work on lab assignments with other students, but should be able to understand what you are doing. You may not work with other students on the R exam. Anyone caught cheating or plagiarizing will receive a zero on the assignment or test, and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. It is your responsibility to read the official Student Conduct Policy for more information about campus standards and policies regarding Academic Integrity.\nChat-GPT / AI Policy. If you use ChatGPT or other generative-AI software for any part of this class (writing, coding, troubleshooting, etc.), you must make this clear at the top of your assignment by writing : ‚ÄúI USED CHAT GPT TO SUPPORT THIS ASSIGNMENT‚Äù (in all-caps and red text), and include an appendix where you include screenshots of your specific queries and answers. Failure to do this will result in a zero of the assignment, and the professor submitting a report to the Academic Integrity Office. Ask your GSI / professor if you have questions about this policy.\nRespect for Others. We all belong in our classroom, and I hope that everyone feels free and supported to express our identities when relevant. To achieve this goal, make sure that you are treating others with respect in this course. This means considering others‚Äô opinions and perspectives, making sure not to generalize to groups (or ask students to be representatives of their group), and being mindful of the words that you use. (Also remember that nothing is ever really deleted from the internet, so please be extra mindful of the words you use.) While I will be monitoring class posts and communication, feel free to reach out to me if you see another student engaging in disrespectful or threatening behavior. Of course, this extends to me as well - if you feel like there are parts of the course instruction, subject matter, or class environment that create barriers to your success or inclusion, please contact me via e-mail and trust that your voice will be heard and I will not punish you for offering constructive criticisms of my teaching. I‚Äôm very open to learning how to be a better teacher, and always learn a lot from my students.\nSensitive Subjects. Our class will touch on important and potentially sensitive topics that are related to psychology and psychological processes, such as racism, depression, sex, and poverty. These topics can generate strong emotional responses in students for a variety of reasons - such as their own past histories with these topics or their reactions to the ways the information is presented or described. I will try to make sure to give you a heads up when we start to discuss these topics so you can be mindful of your reactions.\nStrategies for success. Do your readings, complete assignments on time, understand how the topics and information relate to what you‚Äôve learned (and are learning), and if you don‚Äôt understand something, please ask the question!\nMost important. Please let me know as soon as there is anything going on in your life that you think may affect your ability to do as well as you would like in this class (e.g.¬†sickness, work, small children at home, threats to immigration status, etc.), and I will do my best to work with you on a plan to succeed in the class. If you‚Äôre not comfortable talking to me directly, you can talk to your GSI who can talk to me about your issue."

(WS) and https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/ (LSR) for students looking for more support.\n\n\n\nYour grade in the class will be based on the following components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10% Attendance\n20% R Exams [10 + 10]\n10% Article Presentations\n\n\n20% Lab Assignments\n30% Final Project\n10% Article Discussions\n\n\n\nLetter grades will be based on the following : A+ is &gt; 96.5; A is &gt; 92.5; A- is &gt; 89.5; etc. Note that an 89.49999 is a B+.)\n\n\n\n\nAttendance (Lecture and Discussion Section): Because we all learn from each other; attendance is required. You may miss up to two lectures and two discussion sections with no penalty.\nArticle Discussion. Each week, students will be responsible for leading class discussion of one article. All students should plan to read the article, and post comments to a discussion forum on bCourses. See the Student Presentation - Description and Rubric for a list of articles, a link to sign up, and a description of what is required for these student-led presentations. Let me know if you have other ideas for ways to engage the class in discussion about an article (or another article you think you would be good for the class to read.)\nLab Assignments : Most weeks, you will work through a ‚Äúlab‚Äù assignment that is designed to help practice the skills we review in lecture and readings. You can expect to work on these in lecture, in your discussion section, and at home as needed. Each lab document will have a set of questions to answer - you should submit answers to these questions as a separate document to bCourses. Lab assignments are due the week after they are assigned; late lab assignments will not be accepted. You can drop your lowest submitted lab assignment.\nFinal Project (Research Paper) : You‚Äôll apply the skills you have learned this semester to analyze, interpret, and share results from a research question relevant to your research interests. There will be several milestones to support this assignment. See the Final Project - Description and Rubric for more information.\nR Exam : For each exam, I‚Äôll give you a novel dataset and you‚Äôll use R to answer questions based on the dataset. The exam will be open-book and open note - you must work alone, but may use any resource available to you (including the Internet). A practice exam will be posted at least one week before the exam. The mini exam should take no more than 50 minutes to complete (we will have class afterward), and you will have the full 3-hours to complete the mega exam.\nExtra Credit : There will be no extra credit offered in this course, even for students who ask kindly.¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer Access. Access to a personal computer is strongly recommended. We will spend time each lecture working in R - a free and powerful statistics program that works with all operating systems and computers. Laptops are available for rent from the library (see Berkeley‚Äôs Technology Loan Program), or you can purchase one that will work for this class for as little as $150 (less than the price of most textbooks, which is not required for this class).\nLate Work Policy. Late assignments will not be accepted. You may drop your lowest scoring lab assignment. Let me know if you cannot attend the exam and we can schedule a make-up exam.\nDiscussion Section Policy : In-person attendance is expected and required for discussion sections. Students may miss up to two discussion sections with no penalty. Please talk to your GSI / the professor if there is a longer-term illness or issue that will prevent you from regularly attending your discussion section and we will work out another arrangement.\nRegrades. Students may ask for a re-grade on exams and papers if they believe they lost points for something they should have earned. To request a regrade, talk to your GSI in office hours or set up a meeting. In the case that you and your GSI cannot resolve the regrade issue, the professor will step in and regrade the exam. For final project regrades just e-mail the professor. When requesting a regrade, you consent to have your score increased or decreased if we find that you earned points you should not have earned.\nStudent Contact. It is your responsibility to regularly check e-mail for announcements. If you have specific questions to e-mail me, please make sure to (a) search the syllabus and / or Google for the answer to your question and (b) contact your GSI about your question. I am always happy to answer any questions in office hours (either during the scheduled time or online by appointment), or before, during, or after lecture. I should respond to e-mail within 24 hours on weekdays (I do not check e-mail on weekends); please send a gentle reminder if I do not respond in this timeframe. Thanks!\nAcademic Integrity. Do NOT cheat. Do NOT plagiarize. To copy text or ideas from another source (including your own submitted coursework) without appropriate reference is plagiarism. You may work on lab assignments with other students, but should be able to understand what you are doing. You may not work with other students on the R exam. Anyone caught cheating or plagiarizing will receive a zero on the assignment or test, and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. It is your responsibility to read the official Student Conduct Policy for more information about campus standards and policies regarding Academic Integrity.\nChat-GPT / AI Policy. If you use ChatGPT or other generative-AI software for any part of this class (writing, coding, troubleshooting, etc.), you must make this clear at the top of your assignment by writing : ‚ÄúI USED CHAT GPT TO SUPPORT THIS ASSIGNMENT‚Äù (in all-caps and red text), and include an appendix where you include screenshots of your specific queries and answers. Failure to do this will result in a zero of the assignment, and the professor submitting a report to the Academic Integrity Office. Ask your GSI / professor if you have questions about this policy.\nRespect for Others. We all belong in our classroom, and I hope that everyone feels free and supported to express our identities when relevant. To achieve this goal, make sure that you are treating others with respect in this course. This means considering others‚Äô opinions and perspectives, making sure not to generalize to groups (or ask students to be representatives of their group), and being mindful of the words that you use. (Also remember that nothing is ever really deleted from the internet, so please be extra mindful of the words you use.) While I will be monitoring class posts and communication, feel free to reach out to me if you see another student engaging in disrespectful or threatening behavior. Of course, this extends to me as well - if you feel like there are parts of the course instruction, subject matter, or class environment that create barriers to your success or inclusion, please contact me via e-mail and trust that your voice will be heard and I will not punish you for offering constructive criticisms of my teaching. I‚Äôm very open to learning how to be a better teacher, and always learn a lot from my students.\nSensitive Subjects. Our class will touch on important and potentially sensitive topics that are related to psychology and psychological processes, such as racism, depression, sex, and poverty. These topics can generate strong emotional responses in students for a variety of reasons - such as their own past histories with these topics or their reactions to the ways the information is presented or described. I will try to make sure to give you a heads up when we start to discuss these topics so you can be mindful of your reactions.\nStrategies for success. Do your readings, complete assignments on time, understand how the topics and information relate to what you‚Äôve learned (and are learning), and if you don‚Äôt understand something, please ask the question!\nMost important. Please let me know as soon as there is anything going on in your life that you think may affect your ability to do as well as you would like in this class (e.g.¬†sickness, work, small children at home, threats to immigration status, etc.), and I will do my best to work with you on a plan to succeed in the class. If you‚Äôre not comfortable talking to me directly, you can talk to your GSI who can talk to me about your issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with Disabilities : Students who require support or adaptive equipment because of a specific disability ‚Äì or would like to be tested to see if they qualify for a learning, auditory, or visual disability ‚Äì can request these services through the Disabled Students Program (DSP) office. Please note that I can only provide accommodations authorized by the DSP office.

    "text": "Attendance (Lecture and Discussion Section): Because we all learn from each other; attendance is required. You may miss up to two lectures and two discussion sections with no penalty.\nArticle Discussion. Each week, students will be responsible for leading class discussion of one article. All students should plan to read the article, and post comments to a discussion forum on bCourses. See the Student Presentation - Description and Rubric for a list of articles, a link to sign up, and a description of what is required for these student-led presentations. Let me know if you have other ideas for ways to engage the class in discussion about an article (or another article you think you would be good for the class to read.)\nLab Assignments : Most weeks, you will work through a ‚Äúlab‚Äù assignment that is designed to help practice the skills we review in lecture and readings. You can expect to work on these in lecture, in your discussion section, and at home as needed. Each lab document will have a set of questions to answer - you should submit answers to these questions as a separate document to bCourses. Lab assignments are due the week after they are assigned; late lab assignments will not be accepted. You can drop your lowest submitted lab assignment.\nFinal Project (Research Paper) : You‚Äôll apply the skills you have learned this semester to analyze, interpret, and share results from a research question relevant to your research interests. There will be several milestones to support this assignment. See the Final Project - Description and Rubric for more information.\nR Exam : For each exam, I‚Äôll give you a novel dataset and you‚Äôll use R to answer questions based on the dataset. The exam will be open-book and open note - you must work alone, but may use any resource available to you (including the Internet). A practice exam will be posted at least one week before the exam. The mini exam should take no more than 50 minutes to complete (we will have class afterward), and you will have the full 3-hours to complete the mega exam.\nExtra Credit : There will be no extra credit offered in this course, even for students who ask kindly."

    "text": "Computer Access. Access to a personal computer is strongly recommended. We will spend time each lecture working in R - a free and powerful statistics program that works with all operating systems and computers. Laptops are available for rent from the library (see Berkeley‚Äôs Technology Loan Program), or you can purchase one that will work for this class for as little as $150 (less than the price of most textbooks, which is not required for this class).\nLate Work Policy. Late assignments will not be accepted. You may drop your lowest scoring lab assignment. Let me know if you cannot attend the exam and we can schedule a make-up exam.\nDiscussion Section Policy : In-person attendance is expected and required for discussion sections. Students may miss up to two discussion sections with no penalty. Please talk to your GSI / the professor if there is a longer-term illness or issue that will prevent you from regularly attending your discussion section and we will work out another arrangement.\nRegrades. Students may ask for a re-grade on exams and papers if they believe they lost points for something they should have earned. To request a regrade, talk to your GSI in office hours or set up a meeting. In the case that you and your GSI cannot resolve the regrade issue, the professor will step in and regrade the exam. For final project regrades just e-mail the professor. When requesting a regrade, you consent to have your score increased or decreased if we find that you earned points you should not have earned.\nStudent Contact. It is your responsibility to regularly check e-mail for announcements. If you have specific questions to e-mail me, please make sure to (a) search the syllabus and / or Google for the answer to your question and (b) contact your GSI about your question. I am always happy to answer any questions in office hours (either during the scheduled time or online by appointment), or before, during, or after lecture. I should respond to e-mail within 24 hours on weekdays (I do not check e-mail on weekends); please send a gentle reminder if I do not respond in this timeframe. Thanks!\nAcademic Integrity. Do NOT cheat. Do NOT plagiarize. To copy text or ideas from another source (including your own submitted coursework) without appropriate reference is plagiarism. You may work on lab assignments with other students, but should be able to understand what you are doing. You may not work with other students on the R exam. Anyone caught cheating or plagiarizing will receive a zero on the assignment or test, and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. It is your responsibility to read the official Student Conduct Policy for more information about campus standards and policies regarding Academic Integrity.\nChat-GPT / AI Policy. If you use ChatGPT or other generative-AI software for any part of this class (writing, coding, troubleshooting, etc.), you must make this clear at the top of your assignment by writing : ‚ÄúI USED CHAT GPT TO SUPPORT THIS ASSIGNMENT‚Äù (in all-caps and red text), and include an appendix where you include screenshots of your specific queries and answers. Failure to do this will result in a zero of the assignment, and the professor submitting a report to the Academic Integrity Office. Ask your GSI / professor if you have questions about this policy.\nRespect for Others. We all belong in our classroom, and I hope that everyone feels free and supported to express our identities when relevant. To achieve this goal, make sure that you are treating others with respect in this course. This means considering others‚Äô opinions and perspectives, making sure not to generalize to groups (or ask students to be representatives of their group), and being mindful of the words that you use. (Also remember that nothing is ever really deleted from the internet, so please be extra mindful of the words you use.) While I will be monitoring class posts and communication, feel free to reach out to me if you see another student engaging in disrespectful or threatening behavior. Of course, this extends to me as well - if you feel like there are parts of the course instruction, subject matter, or class environment that create barriers to your success or inclusion, please contact me via e-mail and trust that your voice will be heard and I will not punish you for offering constructive criticisms of my teaching. I‚Äôm very open to learning how to be a better teacher, and always learn a lot from my students.\nSensitive Subjects. Our class will touch on important and potentially sensitive topics that are related to psychology and psychological processes, such as racism, depression, sex, and poverty. These topics can generate strong emotional responses in students for a variety of reasons - such as their own past histories with these topics or their reactions to the ways the information is presented or described. I will try to make sure to give you a heads up when we start to discuss these topics so you can be mindful of your reactions.\nStrategies for success. Do your readings, complete assignments on time, understand how the topics and information relate to what you‚Äôve learned (and are learning), and if you don‚Äôt understand something, please ask the question!\nMost important. Please let me know as soon as there is anything going on in your life that you think may affect your ability to do as well as you would like in this class (e.g.¬†sickness, work, small children at home, threats to immigration status, etc.), and I will do my best to work with you on a plan to succeed in the class. If you‚Äôre not comfortable talking to me directly, you can talk to your GSI who can talk to me about your issue."

Load one dataset posted to our ‚ÄúDatasets‚Äù folder; make sure to give the dataset a name; check the headers, and set stringsAsFactors = T. Note that some datasets are saved as .xlsx files, and will need to be loaded using a package - feel free to skip these for now if this feels confusing. For each dataset, use R to report the following statistics. Add comments to your code that describe what you learn from the output.\n\nthe number of individuals (rows) in the dataset.\nthe number of variables (columns) in the dataset.\nthe names of the variables in the dataset.\nthe value of the 5th row, 2nd column in the dataset.\nprint two variables from the dataset - what do you learn from just looking at these data? No need for summary statistics yet :)\nWhat is a question you might ask about a variable from this dataset? Why might this question matter?\n\nRead the article ‚ÄúData Organization in Spreadsheets‚Äù. Choose one of the datasets uploaded to the Datasets folder on bCourses, and look over the dataset (and corresponding Codebook). What are some ways that this dataset adhered to these ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù? What are some ways that the dataset did not? What is something from this article that you learned?

Why might this question matter?\n\nRead the article ‚ÄúData Organization in Spreadsheets‚Äù. Choose one of the datasets uploaded to the Datasets folder on bCourses, and look over the dataset (and corresponding Codebook). What are some ways that this dataset adhered to these ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù? What are some ways that the dataset did not? What is something from this article that you learned? What did you have a question about?\nChallenge Problem1. Quarto (and Markdown) can also be used to make a website.

    "text": "The goal of this lab is to get practice describing data and working in Quarto.\nDownload this file as a .qmd from the course page, and open it up in RStudio. Note : you may need to install Quarto.\n\n\n\nOne advantage of Quarto (and R Markdown) is that you can run code in a document. You do this using a ‚Äúcode block‚Äù. In the space below, insert an R code block, type out a math equation that used to give you difficulty as a kid into the code block below, and run the code to see the result. Below the code block, add text for humans to determine whether R got the math problem correct or not. Then render the document as a .pdf and .html file. Did this work?\n\n\n\nLoad the ‚Äúgrad onboarding‚Äù survey into the code block below, and answer the following questions. Note : to successfully render code in the document, you must a) explicitly load the dataset into your Quarto document and b) make sure you have no errors in your code. :)\n\nGraph the variables self.skills and class.skills side by side using the par() function. Change the formatting of the graph to make it look ready for presentation. Add vertical lines to each graph to illustrate the mean (solid line) and standard deviation (dashed lines).\nBelow each graph, report the mean and standard deviation of both variables, and interpret what these statistics tell you about the individuals in our class. (Who cares? What do these statistics tell us?)\n\n\n\nSplit your graphics window into a 2x5 grid, and graph each of the 10 ‚Äúcan.*‚Äù variables in the dataset (e.g., ‚Äúcan.import‚Äù, ‚Äúcan.clean‚Äù, etc.). Make sure each graph contains the name of the variable and that the graph looks good / is intelligible. Note : you can and should use a for-loop to do this! Then, report the frequencies of these variables - what are some things you observe about the data? Does this make sense given what you know about the participants?\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose one of the datasets from the class folder (avoid the one(s) labeled [repeated measures] as we will get to these later. I‚Äôll be focusing on the ‚ÄúPerceptions of the Wealthy‚Äù dataset if you want to follow along with my key when it‚Äôs posted). Look over the accompanying article for a guide to the variables, and identify two numeric variables from the dataset that seem interesting to you. Graph these variables, report the relevant descriptive statistics for each variable. Then explain what these statistics and graphs tell you about the individuals in the dataset, and what other questions you might ask about these individuals (e.g., what do the data NOT tell you?)\n\n\n\n\nUse these notes to answer the following questions. Let me know if anything is unclear!\nPsychologists often want to combine information from multiple questions (that measure the same construct) into one variable. There are lots of different ways to do this, but the first that we will talk about is just the humble average. For example, the Rosenberg (1965) self-esteem scale has 10 questions all related to self-esteem; rather than work with 10 different variables, it might be nice to just average these 10 and report one average number. These are called ‚Äúlikert‚Äù scales. It‚Äôs technically pronounced ‚Äòlick-ert‚Äô, but no one says that because it sounds kind of gross.\nHere‚Äôs an overview (from my 101 class notes) of how to work with such likert scales conceptually and computationally (in R). You‚Äôll need to load the psych library into R; to do this, run the following code in your console.\ninstall.packages(\"psych\") # installs the \"psych\" package. you only need to do this once.\nlibrary(psych) # loads the library. you need to do this every R session.\n\nSelf-Esteem Problems. Use the self-esteem dataset (from the class datasets folder). You should find a codebook that describes these data in the same folder.\n\nCheck to make sure the data loaded correctly. (Note that 0s in this dataset mean the person was missing data.) Report the sample size of the dataset.\nCreate a self-esteem scale from the 10-items. Make sure to reverse-score the negatively-keyed items so that for every question, higher numbers measure higher self-esteem. Graph this variable as a histogram, and make the graph look nice (ready for publication). Report the alpha reliability, mean, and standard deviation of this variable. Below your graph, describe what these statistics tell you about the self-esteem of the participants. What other questions do you have about this variable, or the output?\nThen, graph the variable gender as a categorical factor, and report the number of people who identified as ‚Äúfemale‚Äù, ‚Äúmale‚Äù, and ‚Äúother‚Äù. You will need to do some data cleaning here.\n\nSelf-Esteem is Conditional. Report the mean and standard deviation of self-esteem for people who are identified as female, male, and ‚Äúother‚Äù in the dataset. What differences do you observe? How might we use this knowledge / what other questions do you have? Note : there are MANY ways to do this in R; you can use the subset function or indexing to divide the dataset into three groups - ‚Äúfemales‚Äù, ‚Äúmales‚Äù, and people who reported ‚Äúother‚Äù. Or other fancier methods we will talk about later. See how many different ways you can do it."

    "text": "The goal of this lab is to get practice describing data and working in Quarto.\nDownload this file as a .qmd from the course page.\n\n\n\nOne advantage of Quarto (and R Markdown) is that you can run code in a document. You do this using a ‚Äúcode block‚Äù. In the space below, insert an R code block, type out a math equation that used to give you difficulty as a kid into the code block below, and run the code to see the result. Below the code block, add text for humans to determine whether R got the math problem correct or not. Then render the document as a .pdf and .html file. Did this work?\nLoad the ‚Äúgrad onboarding‚Äù survey into the code block below, and answer the following questions. Note : to successfully render code in the document, you must a) explicitly load the dataset into your Quarto document and b) make sure you have no errors in your code. :)\n\nGraph the variables d$self.skills and d$class.skills side by side using the par() function. Change the formatting of the graph to make it look ready for presentation. Add vertical lines to each graph to illustrate the mean (solid line) and standard deviation (dashed lines).\nBelow each graph, report the mean and standard deviation of both variables, and interpret what these statistics tell you about the individuals in our class. (Who cares? What do these statistics tell us?)\n\n\n\nd &lt;- read.csv(\"~/Downloads/grad_onboard_SP25.csv\", stringsAsFactors = T, na.strings = \"\")\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\n\nhist(d$self.skills, breaks = c(0:5), \n     col = 'black', bor = 'white', main = \"Computer Skills\\n(Self-Perceptions)\")\nabline(v = mean(d$self.skills), lwd = 4, col = 'red')\nabline(v = mean(d$self.skills) + sd(d$self.skills), \n       lwd = 2, lty = \"dashed\", col = 'red')\nabline(v = mean(d$self.skills) - sd(d$self.skills), \n       lwd = 2, lty = \"dashed\", col = 'red')\n\nhist(d$class.skills, breaks = c(0:5),\n     col = 'black', bor = 'white', main = \"Computer Skills\\n(Perceptions of Classmates)\")\nabline(v = mean(d$class.skills), lwd = 4, col = 'red')\nabline(v = mean(d$class.skills) + sd(d$class.skills), \n       lwd = 2, lty = \"dashed\", col = 'red')\nabline(v = mean(d$class.skills) - sd(d$class.skills), \n       lwd = 2, lty = \"dashed\", col = 'red')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI see that students rated their classmates as having higher computer skills (mean = 3.88) than they rated themselves (mean = 3.88. There was also more variation in people‚Äôs self-perceptions (sd = 1.15) than perceptions of the class 0.89. One possibility is that people were coming up with a less differentiated stereotype about the average other student‚Äôs skill, but had access to more information when making their own self-perception of skill.\n\nSplit your graphics window into a 2x5 grid, and graph each of the 10 ‚Äúcan.*‚Äù variables in the dataset (e.g., ‚Äúcan.import‚Äù, ‚Äúcan.clean‚Äù, etc.). Make sure each graph contains the name of the variable and that the graph looks good / is intelligible. Note : you can and should use a for-loop to do this! Then, report the frequencies of these variables - what are some things you observe about the data? Does this make sense given what you know about the participants?\n\nd[,7:16] &lt;- lapply(d[,7:16], factor, levels = c(\"No\", \"Maybe\", \"Yes\"))\n\npar(mfrow = c(2,5), cex = .5)\ngraph.names &lt;- c(\"Can Import Data\", \"Can Clean Data\", \"Can Graph a Variable\", \"Can Render Markdown\", \"Can Define LM\",\n                 \"Can Interpret a LM\", \"Can Interpret NHST\", \"Can Differentiate \\nSD and SE\", \"Can Interpret 95% CI\", \"Can For-Loop\")\nfor(i in c(7:16)){\n  plot(d[,i], main = paste(graph.names[i-6]))\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose one of the datasets from the class folder (avoid the one(s) labeled [repeated measures] as we will get to these later. I‚Äôll be focusing on the ‚ÄúPerceptions of the Wealthy‚Äù dataset if you want to follow along with my key when it‚Äôs posted). Look over the accompanying article for a guide to the variables, and identify two numeric variables from the dataset that seem interesting to you. Graph these variables, report the relevant descriptive statistics for each variable. Then explain what these statistics and graphs tell you about the individuals in the dataset, and what other questions you might ask about these individuals (e.g., what do the data NOT tell you?)\n\n\nI‚Äôm going to work with the ‚ÄúPerceptions of the Wealthy‚Äù study again. First I‚Äôll load my dataset, and check to make sure it loaded correctly.\n\n\nd &lt;- read.csv(\"~/Dropbox/!GRADSTATS/Datasets/Perceptions of the Wealthy/Dawtry 2015 Study 1a.csv\", # my file path\n              stringsAsFactors = T, # to convert strings into factors\n              na.strings = \"\") # empty data --&gt; NA\nhead(d) # did it work?\n\n   PS PD_15 PD_30 PD_45 PD_60 PD_75 PD_90 PD_105 PD_120 PD_135 PD_150\n1 233    27    48    21     0     0     0      0      0      0      0\n2 157    39     0     0     0     0     0      0      0      0      0\n3 275     0     0    50     0     0    50      0      0      0      0\n4 111     9    14    17    17    17     8      7      5      2      2\n5  52    68    32     0     0     0     0      0      0      0      0\n6  11    10    31     6    14     8     8      6      5      5      7\n  PD_150plus fairness satisfaction SC_15 SC_30 SC_45 SC_60 SC_75 SC_90 SC_105\n1          4        1            1    50    24    26     0     0     0      0\n2         61        5            2    19     0     0     0    53     0     28\n3          0        5            5     0     0    11     0     0     0     35\n4          2        7            7     2     7     7    11    11    13     14\n5          0        4            5     0     0    57     0     0    43      0\n6          0        1            4     8    25     8    16     7    11     11\n  SC_120 SC_135 SC_150 SC_150plus redist1 redist2 redist3 redist4\n1      0      0      0          0       6       3       6       1\n2      0      0      0          0       2       2       3       4\n3      0     54      0          0       5       4       5       5\n4     14     14      5          2       1       3       3       4\n5      0      0      0          0       4       5       4       5\n6      9      3      1          1       6       5       6       6\n  Household_Income Political_Preference age gender\n1               NA                    5  40      2\n2               20                    5  59      2\n3              100                    5  41      2\n4              150                    8  59      2\n5              500                    5  35      1\n6              600                    3  34      2\n  Population_Inequality_Gini_Index Population_Mean_Income\n1                         38.78294                  29715\n2                         37.21451                 123630\n3                         20.75000                  60000\n4                         35.37958                  59355\n5                         16.87500                  15360\n6                         40.92448                  57600\n  Social_Circle_Inequality_Gini_Index Social_Circle_Mean_Income\n1                            28.05674                     21150\n2                            24.32339                     65355\n3                            14.44258                    107100\n4                            26.92590                     86640\n5                            21.40106                     56850\n6                            37.08824                     59835\n\nnames(d) # \n\n [1] \"PS\"                                  \"PD_15\"                              \n [3] \"PD_30\"                               \"PD_45\"                              \n [5] \"PD_60\"                               \"PD_75\"                              \n [7] \"PD_90\"                               \"PD_105\"                             \n [9] \"PD_120\"                              \"PD_135\"                             \n[11] \"PD_150\"                              \"PD_150plus\"                         \n[13] \"fairness\"                            \"satisfaction\"                       \n[15] \"SC_15\"                               \"SC_30\"                              \n[17] \"SC_45\"                               \"SC_60\"                              \n[19] \"SC_75\"                               \"SC_90\"                              \n[21] \"SC_105\"                              \"SC_120\"                             \n[23] \"SC_135\"                              \"SC_150\"                             \n[25] \"SC_150plus\"                          \"redist1\"                            \n[27] \"redist2\"                             \"redist3\"                            \n[29] \"redist4\"                             \"Household_Income\"                   \n[31] \"Political_Preference\"                \"age\"                                \n[33] \"gender\"                              \"Population_Inequality_Gini_Index\"   \n[35] \"Population_Mean_Income\"              \"Social_Circle_Inequality_Gini_Index\"\n[37] \"Social_Circle_Mean_Income\"          \n\nnrow(d)\n\n[1] 305\n\n\n\nOkay, this looks good.

There are lots of different ways to do this, but the first that we will talk about is just the humble average. For example, the Rosenberg (1965) self-esteem scale has 10 questions all related to self-esteem; rather than work with 10 different variables, it might be nice to just average these 10 and report one average number. These are called ‚Äúlikert‚Äù scales. It‚Äôs technically pronounced ‚Äòlick-ert‚Äô, but no one says that because it sounds kind of gross.\n\nHere‚Äôs an overview (from my 101 class notes) of how to work with such likert scales conceptually and computationally (in R). You‚Äôll need to load the psych library into R; to do this, run the following code in your console.\ninstall.packages(\"psych\") # installs the \"psych\" package. you only need to do this once.\nlibrary(psych) # loads the library. you need to do this every R session.\nUse these notes to answer the following questions. Let me know if anything is unclear!\nUse the self-esteem dataset (from the class datasets folder). You should find a codebook that describes these data in the same folder.\nCheck to make sure the data loaded correctly. (Note that 0s in this dataset mean the person was missing data.)

In the space below, insert an R code block, type out a math equation that used to give you difficulty as a kid into the code block below, and run the code to see the result. Below the code block, add text for humans to determine whether R got the math problem correct or not. Then render the document as a .pdf and .html file. Did this work?\nLoad the ‚Äúgrad onboarding‚Äù survey into the code block below, and answer the following questions.

    "text": "Psychologists often want to combine information from multiple questions (that measure the same construct) into one variable. There are lots of different ways to do this, but the first that we will talk about is just the humble average. For example, the Rosenberg (1965) self-esteem scale has 10 questions all related to self-esteem; rather than work with 10 different variables, it might be nice to just average these 10 and report one average number. These are called ‚Äúlikert‚Äù scales. It‚Äôs technically pronounced ‚Äòlick-ert‚Äô, but no one says that because it sounds kind of gross.\n\nHere‚Äôs an overview (from my 101 class notes) of how to work with such likert scales conceptually and computationally (in R). You‚Äôll need to load the psych library into R; to do this, run the following code in your console.\ninstall.packages(\"psych\") # installs the \"psych\" package. you only need to do this once.\nlibrary(psych) # loads the library. you need to do this every R session.\nUse these notes to answer the following questions. Let me know if anything is unclear!\nUse the self-esteem dataset (from the class datasets folder).

At the end of each chapter, there will be a short quiz based on the content of this chapter that is due before lecture. This way, we can use time in lecture to review and discuss course concepts, and practice working on homework assignments together. The quizzes are multiple choice, untimed, open-note, and allow for multiple attempts.¬†\nCheck-Ins : I will ask you to complete short assessments in lecture and lab documents that consist of multiple choice and/or short-answer questions. These check-ins are graded for completion. It is your responsibility to make sure all check-ins are complete, and that you are logged in with your own UC Berkeley account (e.g., yourname@berkeley.edu). Check-ins must be completed by the beginning of the next lecture (e.g., when assignments are due) in order to be guaranteed a grade.¬†\nDiscussion Section : Discussion sections are a way to review course material, work on lab assignments in a space where you can get immediate help from other students and your GSI. Please attend the discussion section for which you are registered, though you may ask a GSI for permission to attend another section once in order to make-up for an absence or because of some other issue. GSIs will also be in attendance during lecture in order to help troubleshoot R problems you may have during live demonstrations.¬†\nLab Assignments : Every week, you will work through a ‚Äúlab‚Äù document that contains text and videos designed to help you understand key concepts in statistics, research methods, and R. You‚Äôll work on these at home, in lecture, and in your discussion sections. Each lab document will have a set of questions to answer - you should submit answers to these questions as a separate document to bCourses. Lab assignments will be graded for completion, accuracy, and effort and are due the week after they are assigned.\nFinal Project (Research Paper) : Students will conduct a study of their own, and will write up the results as if for publication. There are several milestones for this assignment due throughout the semester. For more details, see the final project description and rubric.\nR Exam : This exam will be scheduled ‚Äúlive‚Äù during our scheduled time. You should plan to take the exam during this time if possible. ¬†DSP students will receive extra time accommodations in accordance with their letters, and students with conflicts for the scheduled R Exam should submit a make-up request here at least TWO WEEKS before the exam date in order to be guaranteed a make-up time. For the exam, I‚Äôll give you a novel dataset and you‚Äôll use R to answer questions based on the dataset. The exam will be open-book and open note - you must work alone, but may use any resource available to you (including the Internet). A practice exam will be posted at least one week before the exam. Late submissions for the R exam will be penalized.¬†\nExtra Credit : There will be no extra credit offered in this course, even for students who ask kindly.¬†\nFinal Exam : There is no final exam in this class. Your final project will serve as the final assessment of your skills and training. Apologies to my former students who had a final exam in this class :|\n\n\n\nLate Work Policy. Assignments (quizzes, labs, and project milestones) are due before lecture. Late lab and project milestone assignments will be penalized 25% for any reason (even if they are 1-minute late), and 50% if turned in more than a week late (after the key has been posted). Students with extra time DSP accommodations should work out a plan to submit work within a week of the original deadline. Students may drop their lowest submitted lab and quiz assignment. Note : in the past, I‚Äôve tried a variety of more lenient late-work policies, and found that these policies often disincentivized students turning in work on time to their overall detriment in the class; so let‚Äôs try this and see how it goes.\nComputer Access. Access to a personal computer is strongly recommended. We will spend time each lecture working in R - a free and powerful statistics program that works with all operating systems and computers. Laptops are available for rent from the library (see Berkeley‚Äôs Technology Loan Program), or you can purchase one that will work for this class for as little as $150 (less than the price of most textbooks, which is not required for this class). Talk to me or a GSI if access to a laptop or computer is interfering with your ability to do well in the course.\nDiscussion Section Policy : In-person attendance is expected and required for discussion sections. Working with other students and your GSIs to review concepts, practice problems, and get feedback on your project is a critical part of the course (and the research process). Of course, the health and safety of you and your classmates and GSIs is most important - please do not attend your discussion section if you are worried you are sick, have tested positive for COVID-19 (or another contagious illness), or have closely interacted with someone who you believe is sick / tested positive for COVID-19 (or another contagious illness). Students may miss up to two discussion sections with no penalty. Please talk to your GSI / the professor if there is a longer-term illness or issue that will prevent you from regularly attending your discussion section and we will work out another arrangement.\nRegrades. Students may ask for a re-grade on exams and papers if they believe they lost points for something they should have earned. To request a regrade, talk to your GSI in office hours or set up a meeting. In the case that you and your GSI cannot resolve the regrade issue, the professor will step in and regrade the exam. For final project regrades, just e-mail the professor. When requesting a regrade, you consent to have your score increased or decreased if we find that you earned points you should not have earned.\nStudent Contact. It is your responsibility to regularly check e-mail for announcements. Please post questions about the class or R to our class discord page, so other students can see the question (and answer) and benefit from your question! If you have specific questions to e-mail me, please make sure to (a) search the syllabus and / or Google for the answer to your question and (b) contact your GSI about your question. I am always happy to answer any questions in office hours (either during the scheduled time or online by appointment), or before, during, or after lecture. I should respond to e-mail within 24 hours on weekdays (I do not check e-mail on weekends); please send a gentle reminder if I do not respond in this timeframe. Thanks!\nIncomplete Policy. I will only grant an incomplete to students who (1) have a significant life event that prevents them from completing the final project at the end of the semester and (2) are passing the class at the point they request the incomplete.\nAcademic Integrity. Do NOT cheat. Do NOT plagiarize. To copy text or ideas from another source (including your own submitted coursework) without appropriate reference is plagiarism. You may work on lab assignments with other students, but should be able to understand what you are doing. You may not work with other students on the R exam. Anyone caught cheating or plagiarizing will receive a zero on the assignment or test, and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. It is your responsibility to read the official Student Conduct Policy for more information about campus standards and policies regarding Academic Integrity.\nChat-GPT / AI Policy. If you use ChatGPT or other generative-AI software for any part of this class (writing, coding, troubleshooting, etc.), you must make this clear at the top of your assignment by writing : ‚ÄúI USED CHAT GPT TO SUPPORT THIS ASSIGNMENT‚Äù (in all-caps and red text), and include an appendix where you include screenshots of your specific queries and answers. Failure to do this will result in a zero of the assignment, and the professor submitting a report to the Academic Integrity office. Ask your GSI / professor if you have questions about this policy.\nRespect for Others. We all belong in our classroom, and I hope that everyone feels free and supported to express our identities when relevant. To achieve this goal, make sure that you are treating others with respect in this course. This means considering others‚Äô opinions and perspectives, making sure not to generalize to groups (or ask students to be representatives of their group), and being mindful of the words that you use. (Also remember that nothing is ever really deleted from the internet, so please be extra mindful of the words you use.) While I will be monitoring class posts and communication, feel free to reach out to me if you see another student engaging in disrespectful or threatening behavior. Of course, this extends to me as well - if you feel like there are parts of the course instruction, subject matter, or class environment that create barriers to your success or inclusion, please contact me via e-mail and trust that your voice will be heard and I will not punish you for offering constructive criticisms of my teaching. I‚Äôm very open to learning how to be a better teacher, and always learn a lot from my students.¬†\nSensitive Subjects. Our class will touch on important and potentially sensitive topics that are related to psychology and psychological processes, such as racism, depression, sex, and poverty. These topics can generate strong emotional responses in students for a variety of reasons - such as their own past histories with these topics or their reactions to the ways the information is presented or described. I will try to make sure to give you a heads up when we start to discuss these topics so you can be mindful of your reactions.\nStrategies for success. Do your readings, complete assignments on time, understand how the topics and information relate to what you‚Äôve learned (and are learning), and if you don‚Äôt understand something, please ask the question!¬†\nMost important. Please let me know as soon as there is anything going on in your life that you think may affect your ability to do as well as you would like in this class (e.g.¬†sickness, work, small children at home, threats to immigration status, etc.), and I will do my best to work with you on a plan to succeed in the class. If you‚Äôre not comfortable talking to me directly, you can talk to your GSI who can talk to me about your issue.\n\n\n\nUC Berkeley offers a variety of services to help support students facing difficulties in these historic times.\nStudents with Disabilities : Students who require support or adaptive equipment because of a specific disability ‚Äì or would like to be tested to see if they qualify for a learning, auditory, or visual disability ‚Äì can request these services through the Disabled Students Program (DSP) office. Please note that I can only provide accommodations authorized by the DSP office. If you have DSP status, make sure you submit your letter and feel free to talk to me or a GSI about any specific accommodations you need, or other ways we might be able to make the class more accessible. [260 C√©sar E. Ch√°vez Student Center| 510-642-0518 | https://dsp.berkeley.edu/]\nStudents with Mental Health Issues : If you feel a mental health issue (e.g., depression, anxiety) is negatively impacting your ability to succeed, I‚Äôd highly encourage you to seek out experts who can help. Berkeley has several free, confidential, and science-based programs designed to help students. [https://uhs.berkeley.edu/caps | Tang Center 3rd Floor | 510-642-9494 | After hours support line : 855-817-5667]\nUndocumented Students : I believe that all people deserve equal access to education. The UC Berkeley Undocumented Student Program has organized resources to support undocumented students, protect their rights, and offer potential financial aid | https://undocu.berkeley.edu/\nStudents from Low-Income Backgrounds : The Extended Opportunity Program (EOP) provides college support services for low-income students. Services include additional counseling, financial assistance (study-time parent grants, work-study assignments, and book vouchers), child-care opportunities, and assistance transferring to four-year colleges. [119 C√©sar E. Chavez Student Center | 510-642-7224 |¬† https://eop.berkeley.edu/]\nAdditional Course Resources. Some students feel that they need additional support in this class. If you find yourself struggling, please seek these resources as soon as possible.\nPrivate Tutoring : I‚Äôve put together a list of students who excelled in previous semesters of this class - you can contact these people directly to coordinate time, place, and payment (some tutors can work with groups, which will help reduce the cost for each student).\n\n\n\n\nTheData Peer Consulting program in the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society. This program strives to help make data science accessible across the broader campus community, by aiming to help undergraduate students, graduate students, staff, and faculty with research project infrastructure or other projects and modules that incorporate data.¬†\nThe UC Berkeley D-Lab. Drop-in consulting where people may be able to help you with R specific problems.\nLibrarians are great. They can help you find research articles for your final project, think about how to organize or structure your literature review, and probably have other powers from a life of being surrounded by books."

    "text": "Use these notes to answer the following questions. Let me know if anything is unclear!\nPsychologists often want to combine information from multiple questions (that measure the same construct) into one variable. There are lots of different ways to do this, but the first that we will talk about is just the humble average. For example, the Rosenberg (1965) self-esteem scale has 10 questions all related to self-esteem; rather than work with 10 different variables, it might be nice to just average these 10 and report one average number. These are called ‚Äúlikert‚Äù scales. It‚Äôs technically pronounced ‚Äòlick-ert‚Äô, but no one says that because it sounds kind of gross.\nHere‚Äôs an overview (from my 101 class notes) of how to work with such likert scales conceptually and computationally (in R). You‚Äôll need to load the psych library into R; to do this, run the following code in your console.\ninstall.packages(\"psych\") # installs the \"psych\" package. you only need to do this once.\nlibrary(psych) # loads the library. you need to do this every R session.\n\nSelf-Esteem Problems. Use the self-esteem dataset (from the class datasets folder). You should find a codebook that describes these data in the same folder.\n\nCheck to make sure the data loaded correctly. (Note that 0s in this dataset mean the person was missing data.) Report the sample size of the dataset.\nCreate a self-esteem scale from the 10-items. Make sure to reverse-score the negatively-keyed items so that for every question, higher numbers measure higher self-esteem. Graph this variable as a histogram, and make the graph look nice (ready for publication). Report the alpha reliability, mean, and standard deviation of this variable. Below your graph, describe what these statistics tell you about the self-esteem of the participants. What other questions do you have about this variable, or the output?\nThen, graph the variable gender as a categorical factor, and report the number of people who identified as ‚Äúfemale‚Äù, ‚Äúmale‚Äù, and ‚Äúother‚Äù. You will need to do some data cleaning here.\n\nSelf-Esteem is Conditional. Report the mean and standard deviation of self-esteem for people who are identified as female, male, and ‚Äúother‚Äù in the dataset. What differences do you observe? How might we use this knowledge / what other questions do you have? Note : there are MANY ways to do this in R; you can use the subset function or indexing to divide the dataset into three groups - ‚Äúfemales‚Äù, ‚Äúmales‚Äù, and people who reported ‚Äúother‚Äù. Or other fancier methods we will talk about later. See how many different ways you can do it."

What information did you use to make this prediction? How did (or could) you use this prediction to influence outcomes?

I used the information that he is three years old and often has many interests to make this prediction. After making this prediction, I hit snooze on my alarm clock and got some extra sleep since I didn‚Äôt think I needed to get breakfast and lunch ready to make time for a board game in the morning. I was not valid, and he immediately asked to play the game. (We rushed breakfast and we found time to play.)\n\n\n\n\n[In Lecture] Get started on the final project by thinking through a research question you might be interested in studying as a psychology researcher. (Totally fine to change this, but great to start focusing on a question.)\n\nWhat is your question? Why do you care about this question (and / or why does this question matter to others)? How interested in this question are you on a scale from 0 (just doing to get credit for this question) to 10 (this is what motivates you to wake up each day and you will answer this question with the energy and passion of 1000 suns)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy question is what‚Äôs the consequence of seeing bombed out images of war-torn countries on people‚Äôs perceptions of the inhabitants of the countries that were bombed / war-torn?\nI think this matters because we live in a very violent society, and are exposed to lots of images of destruction. I think on one hand, these images can motivate people to feel empathy and compassion toward the victims of bombing. On the other hand, I wonder if it desensitizes people, and dehumanizes people in some ways - if all my exposure to a group of people is seeing them as victims, then I may not see them as full humans. This is my question though!\nI‚Äôm very interested in this question; been thinking about it the past few years - just want and need to find the time? Let me know if you are reading this and also interested and maybe we can start an informal reading group?\n\n\n\n\nHow do your past experiences and background inform this question?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHmm, I‚Äôm half-Iranian, and have family / travelled to Iran, so have some emotional and experiential connection to these places. I also have been very anti-war - think I was influenced by my parents here; my mom runs a ‚ÄúPeace Studies‚Äù program and my dad was suspended from school for leading an anti-Vietnam war protest. I also have a buddy in grad school who studies dehumanization, so was likely influenced to think about these issues from that perspective.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the variable that is the focus of this question? How does this variable relate to affect, behvaior, and cognition? Which aspect of this variable are you most interested in focusing on for your project?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two variables here - exposure to violent images in the news and people‚Äôs perceptions of the inhabitants of countries that are bombed. The focus of the question is really about people‚Äôs perceptions of the inhabitants of the countries that are bombed.\n\naffect : emotional feelings toward the victims : compassion, interest,\nbehavior : helping behaviors toward victims; desire to seek out more information about victims / war.\ncognition : perceptions of humanization / dehumanization; prejudice for / against the victims.\n\nI think all 3 are interesting, though I‚Äôm more interested in the affect and cognition pieces of this question.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the between-person form of variation for this variable? What is the within-person form of variation for this variable? Note : for the final project, I strongly recommend focusing on a between-person variation version of the variable for the final project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween person variation : how much someone who sees war images differs in their perception of dehumanization compared to someone who sees non-war images.\nWithin-person variation : how much someone‚Äôs perceptions of dehumanization change after seeing war images.\n\n\n\n[In Lecture / Discussion Section / Chapter 2] Define two variables in R - one numeric and one string variable (these can be unrelated to your project topic!) Make sure to collect at least ten data points for each variable, and show that you successfully defined the variable in R by ‚Äúprinting‚Äù it in R.

    "text": "Readings and Reading Quizzes¬† : Each week before lecture, you will read and watch videos from a textbook chapter designed to teach you the basic skills. At the end of each chapter, there will be a short quiz based on the content of this chapter that is due before lecture. This way, we can use time in lecture to review and discuss course concepts, and practice working on homework assignments together. The quizzes are multiple choice, untimed, open-note, and allow for multiple attempts.¬†\nCheck-Ins : I will ask you to complete short assessments in lecture and lab documents that consist of multiple choice and/or short-answer questions. These check-ins are graded for completion. It is your responsibility to make sure all check-ins are complete, and that you are logged in with your own UC Berkeley account (e.g., yourname@berkeley.edu). Check-ins must be completed by the beginning of the next lecture (e.g., when assignments are due) in order to be guaranteed a grade.¬†\nDiscussion Section : Discussion sections are a way to review course material, work on lab assignments in a space where you can get immediate help from other students and your GSI. Please attend the discussion section for which you are registered, though you may ask a GSI for permission to attend another section once in order to make-up for an absence or because of some other issue. GSIs will also be in attendance during lecture in order to help troubleshoot R problems you may have during live demonstrations.¬†\nLab Assignments : Every week, you will work through a ‚Äúlab‚Äù document that contains text and videos designed to help you understand key concepts in statistics, research methods, and R. You‚Äôll work on these at home, in lecture, and in your discussion sections. Each lab document will have a set of questions to answer - you should submit answers to these questions as a separate document to bCourses. Lab assignments will be graded for completion, accuracy, and effort and are due the week after they are assigned.\nFinal Project (Research Paper) : Students will conduct a study of their own, and will write up the results as if for publication. There are several milestones for this assignment due throughout the semester. For more details, see the final project description and rubric.\nR Exam : This exam will be scheduled ‚Äúlive‚Äù during our scheduled time. You should plan to take the exam during this time if possible. ¬†DSP students will receive extra time accommodations in accordance with their letters, and students with conflicts for the scheduled R Exam should submit a make-up request here at least TWO WEEKS before the exam date in order to be guaranteed a make-up time. For the exam, I‚Äôll give you a novel dataset and you‚Äôll use R to answer questions based on the dataset. The exam will be open-book and open note - you must work alone, but may use any resource available to you (including the Internet). A practice exam will be posted at least one week before the exam. Late submissions for the R exam will be penalized.¬†\nExtra Credit : There will be no extra credit offered in this course, even for students who ask kindly.¬†\nFinal Exam : There is no final exam in this class. Your final project will serve as the final assessment of your skills and training. Apologies to my former students who had a final exam in this class :|"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Late Work Policy. Assignments (quizzes, labs, and project milestones) are due before lecture. Late lab and project milestone assignments will be penalized 25% for any reason (even if they are 1-minute late), and 50% if turned in more than a week late (after the key has been posted). Students with extra time DSP accommodations should work out a plan to submit work within a week of the original deadline. Students may drop their lowest submitted lab and quiz assignment. Note : in the past, I‚Äôve tried a variety of more lenient late-work policies, and found that these policies often disincentivized students turning in work on time to their overall detriment in the class; so let‚Äôs try this and see how it goes.\nComputer Access. Access to a personal computer is strongly recommended. We will spend time each lecture working in R - a free and powerful statistics program that works with all operating systems and computers. Laptops are available for rent from the library (see Berkeley‚Äôs Technology Loan Program), or you can purchase one that will work for this class for as little as $150 (less than the price of most textbooks, which is not required for this class). Talk to me or a GSI if access to a laptop or computer is interfering with your ability to do well in the course.\nDiscussion Section Policy : In-person attendance is expected and required for discussion sections. Working with other students and your GSIs to review concepts, practice problems, and get feedback on your project is a critical part of the course (and the research process). Of course, the health and safety of you and your classmates and GSIs is most important - please do not attend your discussion section if you are worried you are sick, have tested positive for COVID-19 (or another contagious illness), or have closely interacted with someone who you believe is sick / tested positive for COVID-19 (or another contagious illness). Students may miss up to two discussion sections with no penalty. Please talk to your GSI / the professor if there is a longer-term illness or issue that will prevent you from regularly attending your discussion section and we will work out another arrangement.\nRegrades. Students may ask for a re-grade on exams and papers if they believe they lost points for something they should have earned. To request a regrade, talk to your GSI in office hours or set up a meeting. In the case that you and your GSI cannot resolve the regrade issue, the professor will step in and regrade the exam. For final project regrades, just e-mail the professor. When requesting a regrade, you consent to have your score increased or decreased if we find that you earned points you should not have earned.\nStudent Contact. It is your responsibility to regularly check e-mail for announcements. Please post questions about the class or R to our class discord page, so other students can see the question (and answer) and benefit from your question! If you have specific questions to e-mail me, please make sure to (a) search the syllabus and / or Google for the answer to your question and (b) contact your GSI about your question. I am always happy to answer any questions in office hours (either during the scheduled time or online by appointment), or before, during, or after lecture. I should respond to e-mail within 24 hours on weekdays (I do not check e-mail on weekends); please send a gentle reminder if I do not respond in this timeframe. Thanks!\nIncomplete Policy. I will only grant an incomplete to students who (1) have a significant life event that prevents them from completing the final project at the end of the semester and (2) are passing the class at the point they request the incomplete.\nAcademic Integrity. Do NOT cheat. Do NOT plagiarize. To copy text or ideas from another source (including your own submitted coursework) without appropriate reference is plagiarism. You may work on lab assignments with other students, but should be able to understand what you are doing. You may not work with other students on the R exam. Anyone caught cheating or plagiarizing will receive a zero on the assignment or test, and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. It is your responsibility to read the official Student Conduct Policy for more information about campus standards and policies regarding Academic Integrity.\nChat-GPT / AI Policy. If you use ChatGPT or other generative-AI software for any part of this class (writing, coding, troubleshooting, etc.), you must make this clear at the top of your assignment by writing : ‚ÄúI USED CHAT GPT TO SUPPORT THIS ASSIGNMENT‚Äù (in all-caps and red text), and include an appendix where you include screenshots of your specific queries and answers. Failure to do this will result in a zero of the assignment, and the professor submitting a report to the Academic Integrity office. Ask your GSI / professor if you have questions about this policy.\nRespect for Others. We all belong in our classroom, and I hope that everyone feels free and supported to express our identities when relevant. To achieve this goal, make sure that you are treating others with respect in this course. This means considering others‚Äô opinions and perspectives, making sure not to generalize to groups (or ask students to be representatives of their group), and being mindful of the words that you use. (Also remember that nothing is ever really deleted from the internet, so please be extra mindful of the words you use.) While I will be monitoring class posts and communication, feel free to reach out to me if you see another student engaging in disrespectful or threatening behavior. Of course, this extends to me as well - if you feel like there are parts of the course instruction, subject matter, or class environment that create barriers to your success or inclusion, please contact me via e-mail and trust that your voice will be heard and I will not punish you for offering constructive criticisms of my teaching. I‚Äôm very open to learning how to be a better teacher, and always learn a lot from my students.¬†\nSensitive Subjects. Our class will touch on important and potentially sensitive topics that are related to psychology and psychological processes, such as racism, depression, sex, and poverty. These topics can generate strong emotional responses in students for a variety of reasons - such as their own past histories with these topics or their reactions to the ways the information is presented or described. I will try to make sure to give you a heads up when we start to discuss these topics so you can be mindful of your reactions.\nStrategies for success. Do your readings, complete assignments on time, understand how the topics and information relate to what you‚Äôve learned (and are learning), and if you don‚Äôt understand something, please ask the question!¬†\nMost important. Please let me know as soon as there is anything going on in your life that you think may affect your ability to do as well as you would like in this class (e.g.¬†sickness, work, small children at home, threats to immigration status, etc.), and I will do my best to work with you on a plan to succeed in the class. If you‚Äôre not comfortable talking to me directly, you can talk to your GSI who can talk to me about your issue."

For example, he defined the ‚Äúcentral limit theorem‚Äù with the Galton Board (see image on the right). Whereas before, scholars considered the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù to be the ideal state of humanity (it is closest to all the people; the Platonic Ideal!), Galton considered the goal of humanity to achieve to be better than average - something we have internalized today.\n\nIndeed, Galton had a motivated agenda to use statistics to demonstrate there was a hierarchy to individual ‚Äúeminence.‚Äù In his own words:\nTo conclude, the range of mental power between‚ÄîI will not say the highest Caucasian and the lowest savage‚Äîbut between the greatest and least of English intellects, is enormous. ‚Ä¶ I propose in this chapter to range men according to their natural abilities, putting them into classes separated by equal degrees of merit, and to show the relative number of individuals included in the several classes‚Ä¶..The method I shall employ for discovering all this, is an application of the very curious theoretical law of ‚Äúdeviation from an average.‚Äù First, I will explain the law, and then I will show that the production of natural intellectual gifts comes justly within its scope. - Galton, Hereditary Genius (1869). Linked here.\nWhy does it matter that a super racist invented statistics? I have a few ideas, but would like to hear your thoughts first :)\n\nreasons relevant :\n\nlots of statistics are based on convention; convention based on history; good to know that history to think about whether we want to accept that convention or not.\ncould value certain metrics\n\ne.g., outliers are ‚Äúbad‚Äù\nwhole idea of ranking people\n\ngood to think about who is using these tools; what tools can do; what does it mean to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù things and make things better.\n\nreasons not :"

    "text": "Answer the questions below as a .PDF (you can either render from Quarto as .PDF, or render as .html and then print this html file as a .PDF). Make sure to reference any external sources (e.g., stack exchange; ChatGPT; peer help) that you used at the top of your lab assignment.\n\nIn Lab 2, we worked with the self-esteem dataset. We will work with these data again in Lab 3. Feel free to re-use your code from Lab 2, or look at & learn from my key (posted to the course page) as needed.\n\nLoad the data again and check to make sure the data loaded correctly.\nGraph the variable age as a histogram, and report the mean, median, standard deviation, and range. What do these statistics tell you about the data?\nRemove these outliers in age from the dataset, and explain why you considered them to be outliers. Graph the newly-cleaned variable as a histogram, and report the mean, median, standard deviation, and range.\nDescribe what you learn about this variable (and the participants in the sample) from this distribution. Do these data appear representative of the population? Why / why not?\n\nNow, use bootstrapping to estimate the sampling error of the age variable above. (In other words, resample the selfesteem dataset, calculate the average age from this ‚Äúnew‚Äù sample, save the value somewhere, and then repeat this 1000 times). Graph these 1000 average ages, and report the mean of this distribution of sample estimates (it should be very close to the mean of age in the original sample) and the standard deviation of the distribution of sample estimates. Why is the standard deviation of the distribution of sample estimates so small? Why is the graph of these 1000 average ages normal when the original distribution of scores is skewed??? Make sure you‚Äôve removed the outliers.\nIn Lab 2, we created a self-esteem scale from the 10-item Rosenberg (1965) self-esteem scale. The mean of this variable was higher than the mid-point of the scale (2.5), suggesting that people (on average) tend to see them a little more positively than truly neutral. Another possibility is that this difference is just due to sampling error. Create the scale again (you can copy / paste your code from Lab 2, or use / learn from the key if you struggled with this.) Then, use bootstrapping to resample the original dataset 1000 times, and estimate the average sampling error of the mean. Report the estimate of sampling error, and the 95% Confidence Interval of the mean. Do these statistics give you more or less confidence that people tend to see themselves as higher in self-esteem (than the mid-point)? Why / why not?\nFind an empirical article relevant to your research interests. This should be an original study, where the authors collected their own data. Submit your answers to this question as part of this lab, and also share your ideas in the 205 Vision Board. (You‚Äôll have to log in to your @berkeley.edu google account to edit the Google Sheet.)\n\nExport the article citation in APA format.\nWhat is the reseach question & theory. Just explain in a few words what the authors are studying.\nWho is the Population for this research question?\nWho was in the sample of this study? Report whatever characteristics were reported in the article. If there were multiple studies in the article, just pick one.\nIs the sample representative of the population? Why / Why Not?\nHow might this bias influence the results? Be specific here! Okay not to know, but come up with a few ideas."

I‚Äôm using jitter() on the DV in order to shift the points a little, since they are overlapping.\nThen, I draw a line (defined by the linear model) using the abline() function. I‚Äôve made the line width = 5 and color red to make it POP.\nI can look at the coefficients of the model with the coef() function. These coefficients are described by the starting place of the line when the x value is zero (the intercept), and the adjustment we make to Y as the X values increase.\n\nmod1 &lt;- lm(self.skills ~ class.skills, data = d)\n\nplot(jitter(self.skills) ~ class.skills, data = d, main = \"Jittered Data\") # jittered\nabline(mod1, lwd = 5, col = 'red')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoef(mod1)\n\n (Intercept) class.skills \n   1.9501188    0.3800475 \n\n# intercept = 1.95 = the predicted value of Y when ALL X values are ZERO.\n# slope = .38 = relationship between class.skills and our DV (self.skills)\n### as class.skills increase by ONE, then self.skills will increase by .38\n### these units are in the original unit of measurement (1-5 likert scale.)\n\n\n\nThere is Error in Our Prediction (residual error ‚Äì&gt; R^2)\nIn the graph above, I can see that the dots are not all exactly on the line. My predictions are wrong; this is residual error! For example, a person with an actual self-skill score of 2 has as a class-skill rating of 1. Our prediction of this person‚Äôs self-skill score, based on their class-skill rating of 1 is the the result of the linear model :\n\nself.skill ~ 1.95 + .38 * class.skill\nself.skill ~ 1.95 + .38 * 1\nself.skill ~ 2.33\n\nSo the person‚Äôs residual score = the difference between their actual score and our prediction = 2 - 2.33 = -.33. Fortunately, R does the residual calcualtions for us, from the linear model object.\n\nmod1$residuals # R does the residual calculation for us. what will happen if we add this up?\n\n          1           2           3           4           5           6 \n 0.52969121  0.52969121  1.90973872 -0.47030879  1.90973872  1.52969121 \n          7           8           9          10          11          12 \n 0.14964371 -0.47030879  0.52969121  1.14964371  0.52969121 -1.47030879 \n         13          14          15          16          17          18 \n-0.85035629 -0.09026128 -0.85035629 -0.09026128  0.52969121 -0.47030879 \n         19          20          21          22          23          24 \n 1.14964371 -0.47030879 -2.09026128 -2.85035629  1.14964371 -0.71021378 \n         25          26          27          28          29          30 \n 0.52969121 -0.47030879 -0.47030879  1.52969121 -0.47030879 -1.47030879 \n         31          32          33 \n-0.09026128 -0.33016627  0.52969121 \n\nsum(mod1$residuals) # they add to....\n\n[1] -1.776357e-15\n\nSSE &lt;- sum(mod1$residuals^2) # so I square them\nSSE # the total squared error when I use my model to make predictions.\n\n[1] 38.3753\n\n## Visualizing Our Errors.

    "text": "Problem 1 (In Discussion Section)\n\nUse the self-esteem dataset (from Labs 2 and 3) to determine whether there is a relationship between self-esteem and age. Feel free to re-use your code (or Professor‚Äôs code) from Labs 2 and 3. Include a graph of your linear model, and report the intercept and slope from the model. Below these statistics, explain what they tell you about the relationship between these two variables, and how you can see them on the graph.\n\n\nCalculate R^2 ‚Äúby hand‚Äù; confirm you did this correctly by comparing to the value that R calculates (you can access this by running summary(mod)$r.squared, with (mod) being the name of your model object. Note that in order to get the exact same value as R, you‚Äôll need to compare the residuals in your linear model to residuals when calculating the mean of only the participants who had data on both age and self-esteem. There are different ways to do this, but when calculating SST you can use the data from the linear model by calling mod$model$SELFES (assuming you named your model mod and your self-esteem variable SELFES). Below your R code, describe what this statistic tells you about the relationship between age and self-esteem.\n\n\nRun a for-loop to estimate the amount of sampling error in the slope from this linear model, and use this estimate of sampling error to define the 95% Confidence Interval for the slope. The steps you‚Äôll take are similar to what we‚Äôve done before with the for-loop; this time you‚Äôll need to extract the slope from a model of re-sampled data. I recorded a bonus video at the very end of our posted lecture video walking through how to do this (and code is also in the Lecture document.) Note : a 95% confidence interval for a slope is defined as slope ¬± 1.96 * sampling error."

    "text": "Presentations\n\nAssumptions of Linear Regression.\nThe interpretation of our linear model depends on a variety of different assumptions being met. You can read more about these from the great Gelman & Hill‚Äôs textbook : Data Analysis Using Regression. But below is a TLDR, with a few ideas of my own thrown in :)\n\nValidity. Is your linear model the right model to answer the research question that you have? This is the big question, and often goes beyond the specific statistics that we are focusing on. Did you include the right variables in your model, or are you leaving something out? Are you studying the right sample of people, drawn from the right population? Are your measures valid? This is hard to do, and good to remember that it is hard so you ask yourself ‚Äúam I doing a good job‚Äù?\nReliability of Measures. The variables in your linear model should be measured with low error (‚Äúgarbage in, garbage out‚Äù). There are different ways to assess reliability.\n\nCronbach‚Äôs alpha (psych::alpha()) is good for assessing the inter-item reliability of a likert scale.\nThe Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) is often used for observational ratings where multiple judges form impressions of the same target.\nTest-retest reliability is a great way to ensure that physiological or single-item measures will yield repeatable measures over time (assuming the target of measurement has not changed between time points). One way to test this is to define a linear model to predict the measure at one time point from the measure at another; you‚Äôd expect to see a strong relationship.\n\nIndependence. This is a big one - the residuals in your model need to be unrelated to each other. That is, I should not be able to predict the value of one error from another error. When the data in a linear model come from distinct individuals who are unrelated to each other, this assumption is usually considered to be met. However, there are often types of studies where the data are not independent.\n\nNested Data : Often times, individuals in a dataset belong to a group where there‚Äôs a clear dependence. For example, the happiness of individual members of a family is probably dependent on one another (since they share the same environment, stressors, etc.); the test-scores of children in a school are probably all related to each other (since they share the same teachers, administrators, funding, lead exposure in the drinking water, etc.)\nRepeated Measures : If a person is measured multiple times, then their data at one time point will be related to their data at the second time point, since they are coming from the same person, with the same past experiences and beliefs and genetics and all that other good stuff.\n\nIf the data are not independent, then we will need to account for the dependence in the data. We will learn to do this when we review Multilevel Linear Models. (Spoiler : it‚Äôs more lines.)\nLinearity. The dependent (outcome) variable should be the result of one or more linear functions (slopes). In other words, the outcome is the result of a bunch of straight lines. If the straight lines don‚Äôt properly ‚Äúfit‚Äù or ‚Äúexplain‚Äù your data, then maybe you need some non-straight lines‚Ä¶you could bend the line (add a quadratic term), look for an interaction term (that tests whether there‚Äôs a multiplicative relationship between the variables), or apply a non-linear transformation to the data (i.e., often times income is log transformed, since a 9,000 point difference between 1000 and 10,000 dollars/month is not the same as a 9,000 point difference between 1,000,000 and 1,009,000 dollars/month).\nEqual Variance of Errors (Homoscedasticity). The errors associated with the predicted values of the DV (the residuals) should be similar for all different values of the IV. Homoscedasticity means that the residual errors in our outcome variable are distributed the same across the different values of the IV. Heteroscedasticity means there is some non-constant variability in errors, which means that your model may not be an appropriate explanation of the data.\nNormality of Errors (Residuals and Sampling). This assumption is less emphasized as our datasets have gotten larger, and methods for estimating sampling error have improved. But the basic idea is that statistics like confidence intervals and estimates of slopes assume that the errors in our model are normally distributed. If they are not, it‚Äôs likely that your model is not appropriately fitting the data (i.e., maybe some outliers are influencing the results.)\n\n\n\nTesting Assumptions in R\nAssumptions 1-3 require critical thinking about your methods and measures.\nAssumptions 4 and 5 can be examined using the plot() function in base R - you may have accidentally come across these when trying to graph your linear model.\nWe talked about how to interpret these plots a little in lecture; here‚Äôs another tutorial that walks through the interpretation. Let us know (on Discord!) if you find another good example / explanation.\n\n\nCode\npar(mfrow = c(2,2))\nplot(mod1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ng[10,]\n\n\n                        Time howgo howlab3 howR hunger stress social organized\n10 2025/02/14 9:24:46 AM PST     7       9    8     10      8      9         6\n   open agreeable givedata love2scroll tired cooladvisor lovebay had.breakfast\n10    8         7        2           8     9          10       7            No\n   have.water food.pref check.phone hrs.sleep checkin.go\n10        Yes  burritos         280       5.5          7\n\n\nAssumption 6 can be examined by graphing the residuals of your model object with a histogram.\n\n\nCode\npar(mfrow = c(1,1))\nhist(mod1$residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay! These are the basics of linear models. For Lab 5, you‚Äôll take a practice mini exam that brings all these ideas together. I‚Äôll post a key so you can check your work / understanding before the mini exam. We will continue to work with linear models for many weeks; and build more complexity to try and make better, more valid, predictions. Yeah!!"

    "text": "Evaluating Linear Models : Z-Scores and Assumptions\n\nZ-Scores to Aid Interpretation.\nWhen we z-score a variable, we describe how far an individual score falls from the mean, in units of standard deviation. This gives us more context about how much an individual differs from the mean (relative to others). Z-scoring a variable also removes the units of measurement (since the units are on the numerator and denominator, so they divide out.) The z-score is considered a linear transformation, because the fundamental order of the data do not change. (We‚Äôll later talk about non-linear transformations, such as quadratic or logarithmic transformations.)\nWhen we z-score both variables in a model, we are describing the relationship between the two variables in units of standard deviation. This is commonly known as the correlation coefficient (\\(r\\)). And so the slope of a linear model where the DV and IV have been z-scored is equivalent to a correlation.\n\nZ-Scoring in a Linear Model\nWe can test this with the code below.

The Opening\nDescribe the question you have, and explain why this question matters\n\n\n2. The Review\nDescribe what past research and theory has to say on the question and your theory. Your goal is to give the reader the background they need to understand why you are doing your study; you don‚Äôt need to cover EVERY single issue on your topic..\n\n\n3. The Critique\nExplain why the past research is not ‚Äúthe final truth‚Äù, and what other new questions might be important to consider (and why these questions matter). Only point out limitations with past research that you will address in your study; other limitations that you think future research will address should go in the discussion section.\n\n\n4.

At the end of the codebook, the researchers have identified which responses were used in calculating the score; however this code will not work in R. Re-create the narcissism score from these 40-items and report the alpha reliability of this scale. Then, confirm that your calculation of narcissism is exactly the same as the one that was already calculated in the dataset (score).\nHeads up. This question took professor 30 minutes to figure out‚Ä¶so okay if you struggle a little! Feel free to peek at my key (and there‚Äôs definitely a simpler way to do this, but I was feeling stubborn about the approach I initially took). I think this represents the kind of weird data you might be asked to interpret. But I do like to have a small challenge problem on each exam, worth only 1/21 points, just to keep things interesting. FWIW, the likert scale you do on the actual exam will be more straightforward."

A few ways to graph the linear model with the IV is categorical.\nNote that the plot() function draws a boxplot that illustrates the median of each group; whereas the linear model emphasizes the mean.\n\n\nplot(hunger ~ had.breakfast, data = m)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor ‚Äúquick‚Äù methods, I like plotmeans() from the gplots() library.

So, using the model to make predictions of hunger reduces our squared errors by %17 (vs.¬†using the mean to make predictions.)\n\n\n\nSomething New : Cohen‚Äôs D (Effect Size)\nOkay, but people find \\(R^2\\) confusing and unitless and about squared numbers and describes how good the model is as a whole; sometimes I just want to understand how BIG the difference between the groups is. One method people us is to compare the distance between groups, relative to the average distance between individuals (the standard deviation.)\nHowever, if we are assuming these groups are different in some important way, then we may not want to use a standard deviation statistic that considers individuals to belong to the same group. The pooled standard deviation is a weighted average of the standard deviation from each group.\n\nnY &lt;- nrow(brekY)\nnN &lt;- nrow(brekN)\ndfY &lt;- nY-1 # the sample size of breakfast eaters, minus 1\ndfN &lt;- nN-1\n\nvarY &lt;- var(brekY$hunger)\nvarN &lt;- var(brekN$hunger)\n\npoolvar &lt;- ((dfY * varY) + (dfN * varN))/(dfY + dfN)\npoolsd &lt;- poolvar^.5\n\ndiff &lt;- coef(mod)[2] # the difference between groups\ndiff/poolsd\n\nhad.breakfastYes \n      -0.9003175 \n\n\n\nThe psych package has a cohen‚Äôs d function built in that calculates this for you.

Well, this tells us that the difference between folks who had breakfast and those who did not (the slope in our model) is not even as large as the difference between any two random individuals (the pooled sd). But is this a little? A lot?\n\nMany people reference Cohen‚Äôs ‚Äúconvention‚Äù of what defines effect size to be small (d = .2), medium (.5), and large effect (d = .8).
