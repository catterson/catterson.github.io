Below is a short video so you can see what I look and sound like.\n\n\nThe video “It is me, your professor”.\n\nThis textbook will also be part of the flipped classroom approach that we will take this semester.\n\nBefore lecture you’ll read and watch some videos to be introduced to the content that we will then cover more deeply in lecture. You’ll also take a short quiz (no time limit, open-note, and you can take as many times as you’d like) that will encourage you to do the readings, and let me know what topics are still confusing to students.\nDuring lecture we will review concepts that students still had questions about from the readings, and spend the rest of the time practicing and discussing the skills you learned. We will work on the homework assignment together\nAfter lecture you’ll complete any homework that we didn’t finish in class, and then read for the next week’s lecture.\n\nThe flipped classroom approach requires y’all to do the readings and watch the videos before class.\nThe flipped classroom approach also requires me to write text and record videos that are engaging and helpful for the three main parts of this class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf. Cat\nStatistics and R : This semester, we’ll be learning how (and why) psychologists use statistics. We’ll also learn how to use the programming language R.\n\n\nMickey Mouse\nResearch Methods : Everyone’s favorite public domain character is here to help navigate you through the various tools that psychologists use, so you can use them to conduct an independent research project! Hooray!\n\n\nRatty Rat\nCritical Thinking :\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading…"
